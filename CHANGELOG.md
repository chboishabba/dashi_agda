# Changelog

## 2026-05-17

- add the first B0.1 compatible-family surface:
  `DASHI/Geometry/DCHoTTBridgeObligationIndex.agda` now records
  `ProCompatibleFamily` and `ProLimitProjectionSurface` for the DASHI-side
  inverse-limit cone over a `ProObjectCarrier`, plus `ProObjectPoint`, `Im`,
  `FormallyClose`, and `FormalDisk` for the depth-zero formal-disk scaffold.
  The helpers `limitAsCompatibleFamily` and `limitAsProObjectPoint` turn a
  projected pro-limit point into a compatible refinement-depth family. The same
  module now records `WaveCoherentFlatFormalDiskSurface` as the B0.2
  flat-in-the-limit target. These narrow the B0.1/B0.2 construction targets
  without constructing a DCHoTT formal D-space, manifold, G-structure,
  Levi-Civita adapter, or B0 proof.

- fail-close DYTurbo `xs_qt` strict-log artifacts:
  `scripts/run_dyturbo_t43_strict_log.py` now records `jet_mode` as part of the
  strict-log provider metadata and keeps all DYTurbo `xs_qt` outputs
  diagnostic-only. Even if a run supplies native-looking metadata, this script
  cannot set `promotes = true`; strict-log promotion requires a distinct native
  event-level `phi*` provider with the exact CMS at-least-one-jet contract.

- add the AQFT carrier-algebra quotient target surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/QFT/AQFTCarrierAlgebraQuotientSurface.agda` records the next
  typed construction target `A(O)` as promoted receipts over the carrier
  restricted to a region, quotiented by transport equivalence. The surface is
  exported through `DASHI/Everything.agda` and wired into
  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary` as a non-promoting dependency. Restricted
  carriers, quotient operations, and C*-algebra structure are still open. The
  same module now records `CauchyEvolutionReceiptTarget` as the Paper 3a
  time-slice theorem target: carrier data on a Cauchy surface must determine
  the target region before AQFT promotion is possible.

- add the adapter irreducibility no-go index:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AdapterIrreducibilityNoGoIndex.agda` records the four
  empirical adapter no-go theorem targets: metric signature, Born state,
  vacuum selection, and coupling constants. It is wired into
  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary` and remains non-promoting: no
  irreducibility proof, GUT boundary proof, Standard Model construction,
  GRQFT receipt, or TOE claim is constructed.

- sharpen the terminal GRQFT open-obligation wording:
  `GRQFTTerminalCompositionBoundary` now records the mass gap as an open
  spectral property of the composed Yang-Mills AQFT object and updates the
  cosmological constant status to the Adapter2-times-Adapter4
  vacuum/renormalisation calibration mismatch with the 120-order discrepancy
  explicitly named.

- add Monster and Monster-LILA as external artifact submodules:
  `monster` is now recognized as the existing pinned
  `meta-introspector/monster` submodule, and `Monster-LILA` has been added as a
  pinned `meta-introspector/Monster-LILA` submodule. `Docs/MonsterAndLILAExternalArtifactIntake.md`
  records both as external experimental/reference artifacts only, with AGPL /
  commercial-license cautions and no DASHI theorem, Paper 1, DCHoTT/AQFT/GRQFT,
  or LHC-provider promotion.

- add post-submission DCHoTT/AQFT scaffold surfaces:
  `DASHI/Geometry/DCHoTTBridgeObligationIndex.agda` decomposes B0 into the
  four open bridge obligations `carrierToDSpace`, `waveCoherentToFlat`,
  `refinementToGStr`, and `gStrToLeviCivita`, while keeping B0 unproved and
  constructorless for promotion authority. `DASHI/Physics/QFT/AQFTTypedNetSurface.agda`
  adds a typed region/local-algebra interface for isotony, causality,
  time-slice, and descent without constructing a C*-algebra, GNS state, Born
  rule adapter, vacuum, interacting QFT, Standard Model, or GRQFT receipt.
  Both modules are exported through `DASHI/Everything.agda`.

- complete the Paper 1 external bridge pack:
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now add the
  §2 B0--B5 bridge layer between the background and derivation spine. The new
  text binds DCHoTT geometry, Haag-Kastler/AQFT, interacting-QFT boundaries,
  compression admissibility, and honest-frontier obligations to the
  corresponding repo receipts without promoting B0, non-flat Levi-Civita, GR,
  interacting QFT, Standard Model, or GRQFT closure. §11 now cites the
  operational TRBD decomposition surface and native Z+jet/event-level-`phi*`
  provider blocker; §12 adds the MDL non-increase law from the compression
  admissibility receipt; §14 and the receipt index now include DCHoTT/AQFT/GRQFT
  rows. `ClaimLedger.md`, `TODO.md`, and `Paper1_References.bib` were synced
  with the new bridge wording and references.

- polish Paper 1 positioning around carrier geometry:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now present the constructive ultrametric
  carrier geometry as the mathematical thesis while keeping closure semantics
  as certification infrastructure. The target-equation block is renamed to
  target obligation surfaces, the opening replaces framework/lane posture with
  carrier-geometry and bounded empirical-receipt wording, and the conclusion
  now ends on staged derivation surfaces rather than a governance-centered
  frontier claim.

- tighten Paper 1 Section 5 application prose:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now compress the G2/G3/G6/E8 application
  table, replace remaining "Paper 1 may" status narration with direct
  positive-result and open-obstruction statements, and make the G2 subsection
  construction-first around directed plaquette neighborhoods.

- record the Drell-Yan t43 provider audit:
  `Docs/DYLaneProviderAudit.md` now states the active HEPData `t43/t44`
  contract as a native `phi*` `50-76 / 76-106` ratio with at least one jet
  required. `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DrellYanLogLinearShapeLawReceipt.agda`
  adds `DYLaneProviderAuditReceipt` and updates the strict-log diagnostic
  summary so the current blocker is a missing native-`phi*`, exact-jet
  provider. Existing DYTurbo `xs_qt` outputs remain diagnostic and
  non-promoting; the next promotable route is Rivet `CMS_2022_I2079374` on a
  Z+jet generator or a DYTurbo native-`phi*` plus exact-jet implementation.

- add the compressed GR/QFT import roadmap:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExternalFormalImportRoadmapReceipt.agda` records
  DCHoTT-Agda, Haag-Kastler/AQFT-net, and Schreiber cohesive HoTT as external
  import candidates for compressing the metric-adapter, QFT-carrier, and
  GRQFT ambient-framework timeline. `Docs/CompressedGRQFTImportRoadmap.md`
  captures the dependency-intake, import-shim, DCHoTT bridge, AQFT-net receipt,
  and GRQFT consumer-staging plan. The receipt is explicitly non-promoting:
  no external theorem is currently imported into a DASHI adapter. A follow-up
  local-overlap audit now records that DASHI already has flat Levi-Civita,
  GR/QFT consumer-obligation, and adapter-boundary surfaces in repo. The
  DCHoTT dependency has since been cloned locally at
  `ca8c755af0b26f8f50c5a60d3b7f9384a26f5d0e`; `dashi-agda.agda-lib` includes
  `DCHoTT-Agda`; and `DASHI/Geometry/DCHoTTImportShim.agda` typechecks against
  the actual flat DCHoTT modules (`Manifolds`, `FormalDiskBundle`,
  `G-structure`). `DASHI/Geometry/LeviCivitaBridge.agda` now typechecks a
  non-promoting bridge against the actual exported `G-structures` socket,
  links the existing flat `GRConcreteLeviCivita` prerequisite and downstream
  `DiscreteEinsteinTensorCandidate` diagnostic, and records B0 geometric
  emergence as the first open obligation. `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AQFTNetReceipt.agda` now records the
  Haag-Kastler stack contract as a stdlib-only receipt: locally covariant AQFT
  as a point of the HK 2-functor, isotony, causality, time-slice, descent, and
  the Klein-Gordon witness surface. `KleinGordonAQFTReceipt.agda` now records
  the cited Theorem 4.41 free-field stack witness, and
  `InteractingQFTBoundaryReceipt.agda` records constructive interacting local
  algebra nets, renormalisation, and coupling calibration as open boundary
  obligations. Non-flat Levi-Civita import, concrete AQFT algebra-net carriers,
  GNS/vacuum selection, Born rule derivation, interacting QFT construction,
  proof-grade B0, and the cohesive bridge theorem remain absent.

- reorder the Paper 1 opening around reader orientation:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now open with the abstract and concise
  introduction before the target field equations, core carrier grammar, and
  derivation map. The carrier tuple remains early but no longer appears as the
  first object after the title, and the target/core/map blocks stay unnumbered
  so the existing theorem section numbers are preserved. Theorem 10.2's
  projection-defect display now uses explicit section application instead of a
  fragile composed-map display.

- compress Paper 1 framework narration after derivation pass:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now tighten Section 5, QFT/GR/measurement
  wording, empirical contact, compression, closure frontier, reproducibility,
  glossary, Appendix C, and conclusions. The pass deletes the redundant
  certification-flow table, replaces "forbidden promotion" with "unsupported
  stronger claim", compresses the sibling experiment inventory into a
  diagnostic origins paragraph, removes repo-local references from the main
  `\nocite` set, and adds a standard filtered/graded algebra reference.

- tighten Paper 1 mathematical prose voice:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now replace the remaining
  ontology-narration phrasing in the Introduction, Background, Section 4,
  Compression section, and Conclusions with direct object/property/consequence
  statements. The pass keeps the theorem topology unchanged while making the
  carrier, projection-defect, filtration, lane-action, and UFT descriptions
  read as mathematical exposition rather than framework self-description.

- harden Paper 1 namespace, figure, and citation infrastructure:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now clarify that G2/G3/G6 are
  DASHI-native derivation-lane labels rather than claims about same-named
  external mathematical objects. The manuscript adds glossary and symbol-index
  appendices, shortens the non-claim section, splits the old origin diagnostics
  plate into three larger figure groups, and expands `Paper1_References.bib`
  with strategic anchors for ultrametrics/p-adics, gauge/lattice geometry, GR,
  QFT/operator scaffolding, root systems, dependent type theory, MDL, and
  Drell-Yan.

- add the Marx algebraic derivative receipt:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MarxDialecticalDerivativeReceipt.agda` records Marx's
  finite-difference route as a non-promoting DASHI receipt: ordinary
  displacement, algebraic factorization witness, lawful collapse, and promoted
  operational symbol. The receipt now also names the admissible algebraic
  factorization class and theorem-shaped power/linearity/product/chain rule
  receipts. `Docs/MarxDialecticalDerivativeReceipt.md` ties the bridge to local
  PDF anchors from Marx's mathematical manuscripts and to the repo's existing
  fascistic/antifascistic boundary vocabulary: premature projection is blocked
  collapse, while cancellation after factorization is witness-preserving
  contraction. No modern-analysis, differential-geometry, political/economic,
  or complete calculus-tower promotion is constructed.

- add the calculus completion pack:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CalculusCompletionPack.agda` records the next
  post-Marx calculus layers as bounded DASHI surfaces: analytic completion,
  topology, Banach/Hilbert carriers, measure/integration, and
  infinite-dimensional Frechet-style calculus. `Docs/CalculusCompletionPack.md`
  documents the same roadmap and keeps the Python/Lean/Agda workflow split out
  of Agda. The pack is an adapter/roadmap receipt only; it does not claim a
  completed proof of standard analysis.

- move long Agda identifiers out of Paper 1 explanatory prose:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now use human-readable receipt labels in
  the body (for example, "tracked G6 commuting theorem" and "compression
  admissibility receipt") and keep exact Agda names/modules in a compact
  reproducibility receipt index. This preserves auditability while reducing
  repo-report tone and TeX line pressure in the main mathematical exposition.

- add the Paper 1 origins figure pack:
  a six-lane read-only audit of sibling visual and experiment folders selected
  dashifine ultrametric stills, dashitest tree-diffusion plots, FRACDASH
  branch-density projection, and dashiRTX adaptive-refinement imagery as
  diagnostic-only visual provenance. Stable copies now live under
  `Docs/Images/paper1-origin-figures/`, the LaTeX-facing composite plate lives
  under `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/figures/paper1-origin-figures/`, and
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/FigureCandidateManifest.md` records paths,
  digests, roles, and non-promotion boundaries. Paper 1's origins appendix now
  includes the plate without changing the main derivation topology.

- sync Paper 1's submission-facing and stale adapter surfaces:
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now use a
  stronger derivation-program title, a single-paragraph journal-shaped
  abstract, and explicit keywords. The early derivation map now distinguishes
  G2 schema adoption from Maxwell field-equation closure, and sharpens QFT,
  GR, measurement, and sector-splitting adapter obligations without adding new
  targets. `Docs/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.md` records the same sync note:
  the newer G2 SFGC schema-extension receipt clears schema adoption for current
  core-facing consumers, while Maxwell still needs schema-to-Maxwell binding,
  exterior derivative/nilpotency, Hodge/current/source laws, sector/action
  restriction, covariance, units, and convention authority.

- add the DYTurbo FPC provider-card harness:
  `scripts/generate_dyturbo_cms_cards.py` now emits CMS-SMP-20-003 t43
  numerator/denominator FPC smoke cards plus a manifest that records the local
  DYTurbo 1.4.2 semantics. The local source exposes FPC through
  `doFPC/qtfpc/FPCquad/intDimFPC`, not a literal `recoil = 2` card key, and
  activates the FPC term only when `fixedorder_only = true`. The generated
  cards are deliberately non-promoting because stock DYTurbo cards cannot
  express the exact CMS leading/subleading lepton pT cuts (`25/20 GeV`); exact
  strict-log closure still requires a compiled `user_cuts.h` path or an
  external fiducial provider artifact.

- add UI-facing progress for long DYTurbo jobs:
  `scripts/run_dyturbo_with_progress.py` wraps a DYTurbo card run and emits
  JSONL `start`, `heartbeat`, parsed bin-row `progress`, and terminal
  `complete`/`failed` events with elapsed time, estimated completion when
  possible, and output-candidate paths. This keeps FPC/provider runs visible
  during silent pcubature or Vegas phases.

- add provider metadata to the DYTurbo strict-log consumer:
  `scripts/run_dyturbo_t43_strict_log.py` now records provider treatment, cut
  mode, FPC status/artifact, qT-to-phi* mapping, and normalization treatment in
  blocked and computed artifacts, so future FPC strict-log outputs carry their
  comparison contract explicitly.

## 2026-05-16

- add the narrow Paper 1 integrator derivation pass:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now include four targeted inserts without
  changing the manuscript architecture: a root-shell lemma reframing E8/LILA
  as bounded local geometry, a Lorentz bridge from bounded traversal to
  invariant cone targets, a plaquette-ordering theorem deriving the
  Yang-Mills curvature commutator term, and a projection-incompatibility
  theorem explaining residual fibre growth for uncertainty/interference
  targets. The pass keeps all field equations and Lorentz/E8 readings as
  adapter targets unless their receipt surfaces are inhabited.

- address the full-PDF reviewer feedback pass:
  the opening hierarchy now precedes the target equations, a compact
  frontier-at-a-glance table appears after the abstract, compression semantics
  now includes the formal admissibility theorem inhabited by
  `canonicalCompressionAdmissibilityReceipt`, empirical contact now names TRBD
  as a reusable typed residual-basis method, the unreadable narrative diagram
  is replaced in the PDF body by a compact table, and bibliography placeholders
  are replaced with concrete Agda, CMS/HEPData, CSS, and EMST references.

- reorder Paper 1 around the page-early physics equations:
  the target-equation material now appears before the abstract in
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex`, including the transport-defect,
  gauge-curvature, Yang-Mills/Maxwell, QFT/operator, and GR source equations
  plus a table mapping Einstein-side terms to DASHI structural obligations.
  The origins/video provenance section now follows the formal derivation
  sections, and the public narrative diagram has been moved out of the
  introduction.

- replace the physics-facing target table with derivation sections:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now put target equations and obligations
  in the body and add math-first sections for locality/time/causality from
  finite-support traversal, gauge transport from local sections, QFT/operator
  surfaces from filtered quotients, curvature/GR from transport defect, and
  measurement/interference/entropy/sector splitting from projection-defect.
  The GR target equation, gauge curvature equations, and operator/QFT target
  equations are now visible before empirical contact, while all physical
  closures remain residual obligations rather than promoted results.

- add the Paper 1 derivation spine:
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and
  `Paper1_Manuscript.tex` now derive the core carrier route in
  Definition/Lemma/Proof form: primitive ternary state, traversal,
  voxel/hypercube cell, trie ultrametric, tracked `FactorVec` valuation,
  projection-defect structure, and filtration/associated-graded descent. The
  TeX surface now includes theorem-style environments via `amsthm`/`amssymb`
  and builds to the updated PDF.

- recast construction and physics sections around the derivation:
  G2/G3/G6/E8-LILA are now presented as applications of the derivation spine
  rather than as module inventory, and a new physics-facing emergence-target
  bridge maps locality, time/causality, measurement, uncertainty/interference,
  gauge transport, QFT/operator filtrations, and curvature/GR to explicit
  theorem obligations. The closure/frontier language remains fail-closed but
  is less dominant in the paper flow.

- integrate sibling video evidence inventory into the origins section:
  Paper 1 now cites the SIB-R1 boundary in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SiblingEvidenceInventory.agda` and the concrete
  `Docs/SiblingVideoEvidenceInventory.md` inventory, distinguishing dashifine
  GIF/frame diagnostics, dashitest codec/Vulkan/live-sheet/MP4 smoke artifacts,
  and tree-diffusion metrics from DASHI-local theorem authority. The text keeps
  the evidence diagnostic-only until a local receipt binds trace source,
  observation map, metric, admissibility law, rerun command, digests, and
  promotion boundary.

## 2026-05-15

- add first-page formalism and origins narrative to Paper 1:
  `Paper1_Manuscript.md` and `.tex` now open with a compact core-formalism box
  covering the carrier tuple, ternary coordinate, projection-defect split,
  ultrametric refinement, filtered operator surfaces, tracked lane actions, and
  UFT/motif compression as manuscript grammar rather than a universal physics
  law. A new section, `From Ternary Traversal to Carrier Geometry`, records the
  disciplined origin path from trits/Base369 and dialectical unresolvedness
  through cube/voxel traversal, video-like continuity diagnostics, UFT tries,
  FactorVec lanes, and filtration/operator closure. `EarlyOriginThreadReference.md`,
  `SourceLedger.md`, `ClaimLedger.md`, and `OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now
  preserve the source-thread handles and non-promotion boundaries.

- rebalance the Paper 1 manuscript around the mathematical carrier:
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and
  `Paper1_Manuscript.tex` now foreground the ultrametric carrier,
  projection-defect split, UFT/compression semantics, filtration, lane action,
  and local mathematical surfaces before the obstruction frontier. The
  obstruction table is preserved as a later certification layer, so typed
  governance remains the enforcement architecture without dominating the
  reader's first encounter with the physics-unification substrate.

- assemble the Paper 1 manuscript and TeX/PDF surface:
  six manuscript workers drafted the lead narrative, formal core, empirical
  contact, obstruction frontier, provenance/related-work, and TeX/PDF assembly
  lanes under `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/sections/21_*` through
  `26_*`. The integrated authoring surface is now
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md`, with a direct TeX
  version in `Paper1_Manuscript.tex`, bibliography stubs in
  `Paper1_References.bib`, a vector PDF figure converted from SVG at
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/figures/PublicPaperNarrativeFlow.pdf`, and a
  compiled draft PDF at
  `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/build/Paper1_Manuscript.pdf`. The manuscript
  foregrounds physics unification as the thesis and typed claim governance as
  the enforcement architecture, while preserving bounded W3 contact, strict
  Drell-Yan failure, W4/W5 authority blockers, G3 quotient blockers, tracked
  G6 scope, local/upstream E8 boundaries, and non-promoting provenance routes.

- add the Paper 1 drafting and reviewer-control workspace:
  `Docs/Paper1DraftSkeleton.md`, `Docs/Paper1InternalFormalMethodsOutline.md`,
  and `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/` now package the fail-closed Paper 1
  manuscript surface. The working folder contains the main manuscript, source
  and claim ledgers, formal-methods positioning, outreach/crosswalk synthesis,
  cross-domain variational-spine boundary, braid-memory current-event boundary,
  and claim-risk audits. This is a docs-only paper workspace: it does not
  construct authority tokens, promote empirical validation, close GR, or expand
  the formal theorem inventory beyond named receipts and non-promoting
  theorem-target boundaries.

- add the 15SSP scalarization and TOE-bridge boundary layer:
  `Ontology/GodelScalarization.agda` defines the FactorVec Gödel scalar, and
  `Ontology/GodelScalarizationTransportDerived.agda` derives the signed
  transport scalar law for the current 15-lane SSP transfer API. The new
  FactorVec closure modules package post-entropy, formal-compression,
  physical-projection, falsifiable-lane, and concrete-prediction receipt
  surfaces. `PostEntropyUniversalityTheorem.agda` and
  `FormalCompressionUniversalityBridge.agda` now also carry explicit
  non-promotion boundary records: the scalarization theorem is closed, while
  global post-entropy universality and physical closure remain witness
  obligations, not TOE promotion.

- attach the first Drell-Yan adjacent-ratio empirical lane receipt:
  `DrellYanAdjacentRatioEmpiricalLaneReceipt.agda` binds the existing W3
  CMS-SMP-20-003 / HEPData `ins2079374` t43/t44 comparison-law receipt to the
  FactorVec falsification-lane surface, recording `chi2/dof = 2.1565191176`
  and `mean pred/data = 0.9941233097`. The receipt explicitly records that the
  stricter `chi2/dof <= 2` lane target is not passed, so this is bounded
  empirical contact rather than strict lane success. `Docs/CurrentGateStatus.md`
  and `Docs/LimitedSMGRPaperReadinessMatrix.md` were updated to preserve that
  boundary.

- add a fail-closed strict Drell-Yan log-covariance diagnostic mode:
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py --mode t43-strict-log` now compares predictions
  against t43 ratios using the full t44 covariance propagated to log residuals,
  with no scalar refit and an explicit `chi2/dof <= 2` threshold. The persisted
  artifacts
  `scripts/data/outputs/t43_strict_log_phi_star_ratio_20260515.json` and
  `scripts/data/outputs/t43_strict_log_sigma_dashi_v4_20260515.json` record
  strict failures for the current predictors (`283.4574` and `3180.2117`
  chi2/dof respectively), so this mode is a negative diagnostic, not a promotion
  receipt. The same artifacts now also carry diagnostic decomposition fields:
  diagonal-only log chi2/dof is worse (`326.0905` / `5219.4185`), so
  off-diagonal covariance is not the inflation source; leading inverse-covariance
  modes are not rank-1 dominant (`0.0066` / `0.0126` contribution fractions);
  the residuals are instead mostly captured by the `1, log(phiStar)` subspace
  (`0.8905` / `0.9687` chi2 fractions).

- add a G3 associated-graded projection-interface target:
  `G3AssociatedGradedQuotientSurface.agda` now records
  `G3AssociatedGradedProjectionInterface`, a projection-only API for mapping
  selected prequotient `F_n` pieces into an abstract graded-class surface while
  requiring the projection to respect the candidate modulo-previous relation.
  This is explicitly weaker than constructing `F_n / F_{n-1}`: the accepted
  quotient carrier, accepted equivalence modulo previous filtration, and
  Poincare/Galilei associated-graded isomorphism remain open blockers.

- add the cross-domain variational spine boundary:
  `CrossDomainVariationalSpine.agda` defines the common typed object
  `(X, delta, pi, defect, gate, observation, symmetry)` and records molecular
  PES minima, bonding projection/defect density, resonance MDL projection,
  biological attractors, and Kluver perceptual orbit classes as instances of
  the same theorem target. The canonical boundary explicitly allows only the
  structural/compositional bridge claim; quantitative calibration,
  universality, chemistry/biology/perception empirical prediction receipts, and
  cross-domain recovery equivalences remain missing.

- add corrected Drell-Yan strict-log and brain/fMRI observation targets:
  `DrellYanStrictLogLinearSubspaceReceipt.agda` records the empirical
  refutation of the off-diagonal-inflation and rank-1-eigenmode explanations,
  and the positive diagnosis that sigma_DASHI v4 is dominated by the
  `1, log(phiStar)` residual subspace (`0.9687` chi2 fraction). It also names
  `StrictPassOrthogonalityObligation` and a depth-averaged curvature-kernel
  candidate as the next non-promoting theorem target. Separately,
  `BrainConnectomeFMRIObservationQuotient.agda` refines the perception lane into
  `phase orbit -> neural initialization -> connectome-constrained processing ->
  high-resolution/laminar fMRI readout -> behavioral report`, with missing
  dataset/protocol/metric receipts explicitly listed. The brain/fMRI module now
  also records the concrete brain carrier target `X_brain = (V,E,W,sigma)`,
  the connectome carrier `C = (V,E,W,Lambda)`, ternary neuronal state,
  connectome-constrained threshold transition, MDL processing energy,
  connectome symmetry quotient, processing orbit quotient, inverse observation
  target, and the laminar readout factorization constraint. The bridge target
  now includes pointwise gate-law, MDL-order/descent-soundness, quotient
  equivalence, class-of-state, and symmetry-respecting bridge obligations.

- add the developmental genomic inverse bridge boundary:
  `DevelopmentalGenomicInverseBridge.agda` records the forward generative chain
  `genome -> regulatory activation -> morphogenesis -> neural differentiation
  -> developmental connectome -> mature processing -> observable readout`, and
  the inverse condition-probing chain `DeltaY -> DeltaO -> DeltaT_C -> DeltaC
  -> DeltaM -> DeltaR -> candidate Delta g`. The module packages candidate
  regulatory fibres and ranking by phenotype residual, MDL perturbation,
  pleiotropy, and layer-constraint penalties. It now also adds causal-shape
  taxonomy, CRISPR perturbation classes, layered residual compatibility,
  fibre-refinement, laminar-narrowing, and calibration-fixture slots for HBB,
  CFTR, CCR5-Delta32, PCSK9, LCT enhancer, HOX/SHH, FOXP2, and APOE. It
  explicitly forbids DNA blueprint, one-gene-causes-condition, disease-gene
  validation, and biology/cognition/perception closure claims until dataset,
  calibration, inverse-projection, fixture-ground-truth, fixture-ranking, and
  ranking-validation receipts exist.

- reconcile W9 and G6 stale status surfaces:
  `W9PairTransportBridgeObstruction.agda` and
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` now agree with the kill
  matrix that W9 is unblocked only through the MDL termination seam while the
  pressure-equality/Qcore routes remain negative diagnostics. G6 docs now
  distinguish the paper-usable tracked `GL.FactorVec` theorem from the still
  skeleton-only full common-spine section theorem.

## 2026-05-13

- add the W4/W5 public pT-table integral diagnostic:
  `scripts/run_w4w5_hepdata_pt_integral.py` now probes the direct HEPData
  `ins2079374` t1/t3/t21/t22 CSV endpoints, records the CLI 403 / Cloudflare
  failures, and falls back to the CMS public YAML mirror for absolute
  `d sigma / d pT(ll)` tables. The generated
  `scripts/data/outputs/w4w5_hepdata_pt_integral.json` records SHA-256
  digests, source URLs, pT integrals, and ratios for inclusive and
  at-least-one-jet 50-76, 76-106, and 106-170 GeV mass windows. The direct
  pT-table integrals do not match the old `0.8804486068` W5 target, so
  `Docs/W4W5AcceptanceBridgeProviderRequest.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` now record this as a negative, non-promoting
  diagnostic. No W4/W5 authority or gate promotion is claimed.

- add the G3 contraction-carrier fail-closed receipt:
  `G3ContractionCarrier.agda` now checks the selected concrete `P/H/K`
  operator package against the real Schrodinger-scope
  `PoincareToGalileiContractionCarrier` target and records the exact
  non-promotion boundary. The selected FactorVec endomorphisms, p2
  filtration, and bump-commutation laws do not yet supply the wave-function
  scalar ring, Lie bracket semantics, filtered bracket law, associated-graded
  Galilei identification, or contraction-parameter law needed to inhabit
  `SES.PoincareToGalileiContractionDerivedType`. No G3 promotion is claimed.

- add the G2 Phase4 prime-lattice coefficient bridge:
  `G2PrimeLatticeCoefficientBridge.agda` now supplies a concrete
  `PrimeLatticeCoefficientLaw Phase4` for the standalone prime lattice and
  proves `δ₁ (δ₀ f) = φ0` by finite normalization over the four Phase4
  constructors. The same module records the fail-closed SFGC bridge boundary:
  `SFGC.GaugeField` is still `ShiftPressurePoint -> Phase4`, and the exact
  first missing interface is a real `PrimeLatticeEdge -> ShiftPressurePoint`
  projection or prime-indexed SFGC link action. No
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField`, Maxwell bridge, or G2 promotion
  is claimed.

- integrate the next-six parallel lane assignment:
  `G3SelectedCarrierInstance.agda` now gives a concrete selected
  `DASHIState` with `Carrier = FactorVec` and p2 bump/projection laws, while
  explicitly preserving the global adapter gap. `G3P2OperatorSurface.agda`
  now carries adapter-indexed `P`, `H`, `K`, commutator, p2 filtration, and IW
  request surfaces, still conditional on the missing global adapter.
  `G2TransverseEdgeAPI.agda` records that the current SFGC surface exposes only
  right edges and names the missing transverse edge, endpoint, and plaquette
  bump-commutation APIs. `G2PlaquetteBumpCommutationLaw.agda` adds the
  conditional signed-boundary, vacuum-flatness, and d²/bump-commutation law
  surface. `GRSelectedNonFlatMetricInstance.agda` adds a selected non-flat
  metric dependency with inverse/trace laws and names
  `missingSelectedChristoffelFromMetricLaw` as the first GR gap. The V2
  external authority packet set is now split into per-gate provider requests.
  No G2, G3, GR, W2/W3/W4/W5, G6, W7, or paper promotion is claimed.

- harden Lane 6 external authority provider packets:
  `Docs/ExternalAuthorityPacketV2.md` now indexes sendable W2, W3, W4, and W5
  provider requests. `Docs/W2ExternalAuthorityProviderRequest.md`,
  `Docs/W3ExternalAuthorityProviderRequest.md`,
  `Docs/W4ExternalAuthorityProviderRequest.md`, and
  `Docs/W5ExternalAuthorityProviderRequest.md` split the evidence,
  requested authority identity, exact receipt shape, source artifacts, and
  non-promotion caveats by gate. `Docs/ExternalAuthorityPacket.md` now points
  to the V2/per-gate packet set. No Agda gates or external closures are
  changed.

- integrate next-six-lanes follow-up after W9 closure:
  `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now adds
  `G3DASHIStateCarrierFactorVecAdapterRequest`, naming the exact missing
  assumption-free `DASHIState.Carrier -> FactorVec` adapter, p2 bump state,
  factor-vector preservation, p2 exponent, and filtration laws. A new
  `G3P2OperatorSurface.agda` provides a conditional, non-promoting operator
  package parameterized by that adapter, including p2/spatial bump,
  momentum/boost, and commutator-obligation surfaces. `GRNonFlatScalarAlgebraSurface.agda`
  now has `canonicalGRFiniteRCarrierScalarOperations` and an explicit
  conditional non-flat metric dependency surface with metric, inverse law,
  derivative, finite contraction, Christoffel, trace, and Ricci-cancellation
  inputs; `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` consumes this as a request only.
  `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now records
  `canonicalSFGCNondegeneratePlaquetteCarrierRequest`, making
  `ShiftGaugeFieldGaugeConnection`, independent transverse edges, endpoint
  laws, and plaquette bump-commutation laws the first concrete G2 interface
  gap. `Docs/W4W5AcceptanceBridgeProviderRequest.md` adds the provider-facing
  W4/W5 acceptance bridge packet. No G2, G3, GR, W4/W5, G6, W7, or paper
  promotion is claimed.

- integrate the high-alpha follow-up tranche after W9 closure:
  `W7ClaimGovernanceReceiptRequest.agda` now records the current W7 gate board
  as a non-promoting request: W9 closed, W2/W3/W4/W5 external-required,
  G2/G3/GR internal-pending, and G6 downstream-pending; it does not construct
  W7 or `paperAdmissible`. `G6PrerequisiteIndex.agda` indexes future G6
  prerequisites without importing or manufacturing the missing theorem
  inhabitants. `GRNonFlatScalarAlgebraSurface.agda` now separates selected
  non-flat scalar operations, metric dependency, inverse metric laws,
  Christoffel-from-metric, and six-term Ricci cancellation obligations; first
  missing remains the selected `CarrierScalar` operations. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda`
  now adds a four-term SFGC right-edge two-step signed-boundary surface with
  `δ₁` and `δ₁∘δ₀` normalizer laws, but no transverse plaquette or
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField`. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda`
  now records the exact fail-closed `DASHIState.Carrier -> FactorVec` adapter
  blocker after inspecting the real `DASHIState` shape. The paper remains
  blocked at `missingRoadmapGovernance`.

- add the concise external authority packet export:
  `Docs/ExternalAuthorityPacket.md` now indexes the W2/W3/W4/W5 evidence and
  authority gaps without claiming external tokens. It records the W3 frozen
  commit `3205d746...`, chi2/dof `2.1565`, mean pred/data `0.9941`, the
  W4/W5 public `DSIG/DPHISTAR` ratios `t43/Z = 0.048798342138242475`,
  `t45/Z = 0.025440376842598356`, `t45/t43 = 0.5213369087525034`, and the
  missing accepted `A(M,phi*)` bridge / observable-conversion law.

- integrate the post-W9 baseline six-lane dispatch:
  `NonLimitedPaperBundleClaimGovernance.agda` now includes
  `CurrentRoadmapGovernanceGapReceipt`, decomposing `missingRoadmapGovernance`
  into W2/W3/W4/W5 external gates, G2/G3/GR internal gates, G6 downstream, and
  W7 final claim governance while preserving `paperBlocked
  missingRoadmapGovernance`. `W2W3W4W5ExternalAuthorityPacketSurface.agda`
  records the four external gates in one packet and explicitly keeps internal
  construction unauthorized. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now adds a
  conservative right-edge return plaquette normalizer and local `δ₁∘δ₀` zero
  surface, without claiming a nondegenerate curvature carrier. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda`
  now adds `G3CarrierToFactorVecMinimalAdapter` and the p2 exponent-after-bump
  lemma, without supplying a real `DASHIState` projection. `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`
  now records a selected non-flat finite-r scalar-algebra dependency request,
  without promoting non-flat Levi-Civita or Einstein closure.

- reconcile six high-alpha lanes:
  W9 is now formally unblocked through the accepted MDL termination seam route:
  `BlockerKillConditions.agda` ties `w9KillCondition` to
  `canonicalMDLTerminationSeamW9KillReceipt`, and
  `NonLimitedPaperBundleClaimGovernance.agda` consumes the same receipt through
  an accepted W9 roadmap status. The paper remains blocked on roadmap
  governance, and no pressure-equality/Qcore claim is added.
  `W2W3ExternalAuthorityFormalClosureRequest.agda` records Option B for W2/W3:
  both lanes are pending external authority receipts and no constructorless
  tokens are fabricated. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now adds an
  `SFGCShiftRightEdge` Phase4 1-form bridge and narrows the G2 blocker to a
  right-edge plaquette/signed-boundary/`δ₁` normalizer. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda`
  now adds a fail-closed `G3CarrierToFactorVecExternalInterfaceRequest`.
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now has a typechecked flat Minkowski finite-r
  Levi-Civita closure, explicitly non-promoting for selected non-flat GR.
  `W4W5PhiStarToMassAcceptanceBridgeRequest.agda` and the public-ratio runner
  now record the checked CMS/HEPData/Zenodo links, the CLI HEPData JSON 403, and
  the exact missing `A(M, phi*)` / conversion law without promoting
  `0.5213369087525034` to `0.8804486068`.

- integrate six-lane follow-up worker assignment:
  `BlockerKillConditions.agda` now includes `mdlTerminationSeamRoute` on
  `W9KillRouteReceipt`, with `canonicalMDLTerminationSeamW9KillReceipt`
  inhabiting `W9KillReceipt` through the existing MDL termination seam
  consumer. The broader canonical blocker row and non-limited roadmap bundle
  are intentionally not promoted yet. `W2W3GovernancePolicyHookRequest.agda`
  now records the exact Option-B ruling: the policy permits evidence classes
  but does not authorize token constructors. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda`
  now packages finite `Phase4` abelian coefficient laws plus a point-link
  `connectionToPointLink1Form` bridge and vacuum-zero law; prime-lattice
  curvature remains open. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now exposes
  `G3DASHIStateP2ProjectionInterface` over the real `DASHIState.Carrier` /
  `carrierValue` accessors. `W4W5PhiStarToMassAcceptanceBridgeRequest.agda`
  records that public CMS/HEPData artifacts do not provide the acceptance law
  needed to identify `0.5213369087525034` with the old `0.8804486068`
  correction surface. `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now has a flat constant
  finite-r prerequisite from `MinkowskiLimitReceipt`, while selected non-flat
  GR remains blocked on scalar algebra and Levi-Civita/Ricci ingredients.

- integrate six-lane implementation tranche without promotion:
  `scripts/run_w4w5_hepdata_public_ratio_integral.py` now emits a bounded
  public HEPData ratio-integral diagnostic and
  `scripts/data/outputs/w4w5_hepdata_public_ratio_integral.json` records the
  current run. The local CSVs support a `DSIG/DPHISTAR` / `DSIG/DPHISTAR`
  ratio-table diagnostic rather than a `dσ/dM` mass-window integral; computed
  supported ratios are `t43/Z = 0.048798342138242475`,
  `t45/Z = 0.025440376842598356`, and `t45/t43 = 0.5213369087525034`, with no
  W4/W5 promotion. `W4W5PublicHEPDataRatioDiagnostic.agda` now binds those
  three numbers as the public-table diagnostic result and explicitly separates
  `0.5213369087525034` from the older `0.8804486068` PDF-carrier target.
  `BlockerKillConditionsBase.agda` splits neutral kill-state
  vocabulary from the W9 kill matrix so the MDL route request no longer depends
  on the full kill matrix, but no accepted `W9KillRouteReceipt` constructor is
  added. `W2W3GovernancePolicyHookRequest.agda` records that current policy
  does not authorize token-producing hooks. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda`
  now names `missingGaugeFieldAtProjection` and the required
  `connectionTo1Form` / vacuum-real SFGC API. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda`
  now names the real `DASHIState` p2 prime-address interface request.
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now includes a
  `GRChristoffelFromMetricSixTermRicciIdentityRequest`. All changes preserve
  the current blocked/non-promoting status.

- integrate hard-core pressure-point round:
  `NonLimitedPaperBundleClaimGovernance.agda` now includes a typed
  `HardCorePressurePointBundle` for the five active pressure points: W9 MDL
  kill-matrix consumer, G2 oriented-boundary/incidence algebra, G3
  carrier-operator contraction, GR Levi-Civita metric compatibility, and G6
  lane embedding orthogonality. The canonical bundle records all five as
  route-change-required, typed-but-uninhabited, or downstream-gated; the
  computed paper admissibility remains `paperBlocked missingRoadmapGovernance`.
  `TODO.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`
  now record the worker returns and non-promotion boundaries.

- advance W9/G2/G3/GR/G6 pressure surfaces without promotion:
  `W9MDLTerminationSeamRoute.agda` now wires the MDL witness's retarget
  acceptance into the non-promoting consumer, but the kill matrix still lacks
  an accepted `mdlTerminationSeamRoute`. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda`
  adds signed-boundary helper lemmas and a
  `SignedBoundaryIncidenceSummationSurface`, but no SFGC instantiation or
  `d²=0` theorem. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` adds concrete
  carrier-operator/action-law/commutator obligation records.
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` adds explicit metric-compatibility and
  `carrierConnectionIsLeviCivita` pressure surfaces.
  `CrossLaneCommutingTheoremSkeleton.agda` adds conditional p2 orthogonality
  specialization and an actual embedding dependency index. None of W9, G2,
  G3, GR, G6, W7, the non-limited paper, or full unification is promoted.

- adapt supplied hard-core inhabitants to current Agda interfaces:
  `BlockerKillConditions.agda` now records a
  `W9MDLTerminationSeamAcceptedRouteRequest`, preserving the blocked state and
  naming the import-cycle boundary that prevents directly consuming the MDL
  seam from the kill matrix. `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now adds the
  corrected square boundary/signed-sum surface and a
  `G2SFGCGaugeFieldCurvatureAPIObstruction` rather than constructing a fake
  shift-gauge curvature carrier. `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now
  includes a unit smoke carrier inhabiting the local operator obligation
  records while recording the missing p2 prime-address interface. `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda`
  now factors the Levi-Civita path through a standard algebra-law obligation
  and explicitly names the six-term Ricci identity cancellation as the next
  selected-metric sub-obligation. All changes are non-promoting.

- sharpen GR/G6 algebraic consequence surfaces:
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now separates the conditional
  `GRFiniteRRicciFromBianchiObligation` / vacuum Ricci-zero surface from the
  Jacobi-to-Bianchi sidecar and explicitly names missing metric contraction,
  trace=4 reduction, curvature-to-Ricci boundary, and stress-energy
  compatibility. `CrossLaneCommutingTheoremSkeleton.agda` now provides
  conditional `p2EigenvalueDecompositionCommutes` and
  `primeAddressOrthogonalityCommutes` theorem surfaces from explicit
  p2-prime projection, complex Re/Im, primeIndex injectivity, and orthogonal
  projection laws. No GR finite-r closure, vacuum Einstein theorem, G6 section,
  or complete-unification promotion was constructed.

- add G2 vacuum-Hecke eigenvalue reality obstruction:
  `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now records the attempted
  `vacuumHeckeEigenvaluesReal` lane as a non-promoting obligation. The current
  inspected support has a static `SFGC.vacuumGaugeField`, Hecke compatibility
  scans, and coarse `PHEM.EigenProfile` counters, but no typed `VacuumState`,
  `activeMode`, scalar `heckeEigenvalue`, `imaginaryPart`,
  `zeroImaginaryPart`, `RealEigenvalue`, or `realEigenvalueBridge`. The new
  conditional bridge only states what would be needed before real vacuum Hecke
  eigenvalues could feed a vacuum-flatness route; no such candidate or flatness
  proof is constructed.

- add GR finite-r discrete Bianchi sidecar scope:
  `GRDiscreteBianchiFiniteR.agda` now states the Jacobi-to-Bianchi bridge as an
  obligation over the existing carrier Lie algebra vocabulary, GR first-order
  finite-r surface, Einstein-equation candidate, discrete Einstein tensor
  diagnostic, and CRT connection diagnostic. The canonical sidecar names the
  exact missing finite-r ingredients: base carrier, cell/neighborhood layer,
  derivation carrier, bracket/Jacobi witness, connection or shift law,
  curvature-as-bracket-defect construction, covariant cyclic/exterior Bianchi
  expression, finite-r Bianchi law, curvature contraction boundary, and
  stress-energy compatibility. No vacuum Einstein closure, finite-r GR
  promotion, sourced Einstein law, or GR/QFT promotion was constructed.

- add the W9 MDL termination seam route request:
  `W9MDLTerminationSeamRoute.agda` constructs a real
  `MDLTerminationSeamWitness` from existing receipts: `normalizeAdd`
  one-step canonicalization/idempotence, sum preservation, the
  carry-depth/budget `CancellationPressureLyapunovBridge`, and the
  weighted-support retarget acceptance receipt. The module also defines a
  non-pressure route consumer and records the exact missing theorem-consumer
  route change: add an `mdlTerminationSeamRoute`-style W9 kill-route
  constructor for the accepted non-Qcore MDL seam. This does not construct
  `CancellationPressureCompatibility`, a pressure equality, or `W9KillReceipt`.

- sharpen G2 cochain-complex blocker without promoting curvature:
  `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now records a dedicated
  `G2PrimeLatticeCochainLawObligation` for the attempted `d0`/`d1`/`d² = 0`
  strengthening. `Ontology.GodelLattice` now exposes prime-indexed
  `updateVec15` with `updateVec15-commutes`, and
  `Ontology.Hecke.FactorVecInstances` now proves `primeBumpCommutes`,
  `by-abelian-factorvec`, and `bumpPrimeCommutes`. The inspected `Phase4`
  finite-gauge base still lacks oriented edge endpoints, the corrected signed
  square boundary `+bottom,+right,-top,-left`, `boundaryOfBoundaryZero`, finite
  incidence summation, and a `Phase4` abelian-group normalizer/proof package,
  so `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` adds a typed
  `CorrectedSquareBoundaryCochainSurface` obligation instead of constructing a
  concrete cochain proof or `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField`.
  `Docs/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` record the same non-promoting boundary.

- retarget the W9 diagnostic lane to the existing `<=` consumer receipt:
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` now records the
  local `W9WeightedSupportRetargetConsumerReceipt` as the current
  `RetargetConsumerInterface` and
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerAcceptanceReceipt` source for
  `canonicalPairPressureRetargetReceipt`. The accepted predicate is the
  weighted-support bound `weightedMaxPressure <= weightedSupport`, and the
  request pack now asks for an explicit theorem-consumer route change rather
  than another acceptance provider. This remains non-promoting: the W9 kill
  matrix still accepts only the existing pressure-witness equality route or
  weighted cancellation-to-quadratic identification route.

- add W2/W3 governance policy hook request surface:
  `Docs/DASHIGovernanceSelfIssuancePolicy.md` and
  `Docs/W2W3AuthorityGovernanceFork.md` now state that the admissible hook is
  request-only in the current typed state. The new
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/W2W3GovernancePolicyHookRequest.agda` consumes the
  landed self-issuance policy, W2 audit/intake evidence, and W3
  authority-token intake/response evidence while proving
  `tokenProducingHookAuthorizedNow = false`. `DASHI/Everything.agda`,
  `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` index the same boundary. No
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken`,
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, W2 promotion receipt, or W3 accepted
  authority receipt is constructed.

- sharpen G2 prime-lattice 2-cell curvature obligations:
  `G2DiscreteCurvatureCarrier.agda` now exposes a conditional
  `PrimeLattice2CellLayer` with prime-lattice 0/1/2-cell carriers, plaquettes,
  discrete 0/1/2-form carriers, exterior derivatives, a typed `d² = 0` law,
  and the shift-gauge-to-1-form / 2-form-to-field-strength maps needed before
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField` can be inhabited. The canonical
  G2 obstruction now names the missing base types and keeps the carrier
  non-promoted. `Docs/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` record the same boundary.

- add G2 Maxwell curvature/discrete-equation obstruction surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.agda`,
  `Docs/MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationScope.md`, and `TODO.md` now record the
  inspected finite/static gauge support for a future curvature-to-field-strength
  and discrete Maxwell equation route. The exact first missing field is
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier for SFGC.GaugeField`; after that, the first missing
  lemma is `curvatureToFieldStrengthFromShiftGaugeConnection`. No
  `MaxwellGaugeFieldEquationTheorem` inhabitant is constructed, so G2 remains
  non-promoted.

- add W4-gated finite-r GR Bianchi/matter obligation surface:
  `GRFirstOrderGravityScope.agda` now separates the future
  `GRFiniteRW4BianchiMatterTheoremObligation`, parameterized by an
  `EinsteinEquationCandidate.W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt`, from the
  canonical diagnostic surface that records the receipt is still impossible
  here. The surface orders W4 matter/stress-energy, finite-r Bianchi,
  stress-energy compatibility, and the sourced Einstein law without proving any
  of them. `Docs/GRFirstOrderGravityScope.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` record the same no-promotion boundary. No W4
  calibration authority, finite-r Bianchi theorem, sourced Einstein equation,
  GR/G4/G6 closure, or GR/QFT promotion was constructed.

- assign conditional post-W2/W3/W9 next-lane tranche:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now record six downstream
  lanes under the explicit hypothetical that a future commit closes W2, W3, and
  W9. The current repo state is preserved as blocked; the new assignments cover
  W4/W5 shared PDF intake, W4 calibration authority, W3 non-collapse
  hardening, G2 Maxwell, G3 Schrodinger, and GR matter coupling. These are
  conditional staging lanes and do not promote W4, W5, G2, G3, GR, G6, W7, or
  the non-limited paper.

- sharpen the G3 Schrodinger theorem surface:
  `SchrodingerEvolutionScope.agda`, `Docs/SchrodingerEvolutionScope.md`, and
  `TODO.md` now record the inspected finite Hamiltonian/unitary-like support
  and the offline-L2 obstruction certificate while adding explicit
  Poincare-to-Galilei, Galilei/Hamiltonian, CCR compatibility, and MDL-to-L2
  seam obligations. The exact missing fields include
  `poincareToGalileiContractionDerived`,
  `galileiHamiltonianCompatibilityDerived`, `ccrCompatibilityDerived`, and
  `mdlToL2SeamDerived`; the scope now also records their exact upstream theorem
  types as `PoincareToGalileiContractionDerivedType`,
  `GalileiHamiltonianCompatibilityDerivedType`, `CCRCompatibilityDerivedType`,
  and `MDLToL2SeamDerivedType`. No `SchrodingerEvolutionTheorem` or G3 closure
  is constructed.

- sharpen the G3 Poincare-to-Galilei carrier-level obstruction:
  `SchrodingerEvolutionScope.agda` now records
  `G3PoincareToGalileiCarrierLevelObstruction`, naming the exact missing
  carrier/type chain from `PoincareSectorCarrier` through
  `PoincareToGalileiContractionCarrier` plus the upstream theorem type
  `PoincareToGalileiContractionDerivedType
  obligationSchrodingerHamiltonianEvolutionFields`. This is an obstruction
  packet only; no contraction theorem inhabitant or new postulate was added.

- add the G3 Poincare-Galilei carrier-chain surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` and
  `Docs/G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.md` now record the reusable
  `PoincareSectorCarrier -> NonRelativisticLimitCarrier ->
  GalileiSectorCarrier -> PoincareToGalileiContractionCarrier` chain with a
  non-promoting `DASHIState` marker. The exact downstream Schrodinger
  obligation remains `PoincareToGalileiContractionDerivedType
  obligationSchrodingerHamiltonianEvolutionFields`; no
  `poincareToGalileiContractionDerived` inhabitant is constructed.

- continue the G3 Poincare-sector carrier layer:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now defines an
  independent `PoincareSectorCarrier` record with state/operator/action,
  CCR-shaped `Op` and commutator surfaces, metric, translation-generator,
  Lorentz-generator, and Poincare bracket-relation fields. The canonical chain
  now carries a non-promoting obligation packet naming the missing concrete
  `CarrierOperator`, commutator closure, metric/signature witness, and
  translation/translation, Lorentz/translation, and Lorentz/Lorentz relation
  proofs. No Poincare algebra witness or contraction theorem is constructed.

- add non-promoting G3 IW and MDL-density surfaces:
  `G3PoincareGalileiCarrierChain.agda` now records
  `G3IWAssociatedGradedObligationSurface` for the missing contraction
  filtration, associated graded, carrier algebra, filtered bracket law,
  contraction parameter, Poincare-at-`p2` carrier/isomorphism, and Galilei
  associated-graded identification. It also records
  `G3MDLDensityToL2ObligationSurface`, which reuses the inhabited finite
  `shiftPhaseWaveDensityMonotone` and `shiftPointDensityMonotone` laws while
  keeping the positive L2 density/seam theorem as the exact
  `MDLToL2SeamDerivedType obligationSchrodingerHamiltonianEvolutionFields`
  obligation. No unguarded postulate, IW contraction theorem, or MDL-to-L2
  theorem inhabitant was added.

- record W2 governance-token constructor obstruction:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/W2GovernanceTokenConstructorObstruction.agda`,
  `Docs/W2GovernanceTokenConstructorObstruction.md`, and `TODO.md` now record
  that the landed self-issuance policy is permissive only at the evidence-class
  layer. It constructs no W2 token, and the current Agda type still lacks a
  real `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken` constructor or typed
  policy-hook inhabitant. This keeps W2 non-promoted and names the first
  missing constructor before the separate natural/p2 and carrier-general
  convergence payloads.

- assign guarded W2/W3/W9 follow-up tranche:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now record three narrow
  workers for the latest immediate-token/proof proposal. The tranche explicitly
  allows W2/W3 token or W9 theorem construction only if the existing Agda
  interfaces provide a real constructor path; otherwise workers must return a
  typed obstruction or request surface. This assignment does not itself promote
  W2, W3, W9, G5, or the non-limited paper.

- integrate W9 follow-up obstruction sharpening:
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` now names
  `Canonical15PressureWitnessType` as the missing theorem needed to identify
  cancellation pressure with transported contraction energy. The inspected
  case-split, contraction-forces, signature-31, and B4 weighted-Qcore routes
  remain non-promoting because none supplies the required pressure witness or
  W9 kill constructor.

- assign non-limited paper closure bundle lanes:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now record the six parallel
  assignments needed to turn current obligation surfaces into one
  theorem-facing non-limited-paper dependency object: W3/W2 authority
  governance, W9 pressure equality/obstruction, W4 Z-peak data anchor,
  CT18/DY convention binding, G2/G3/G4 theorem kernels, and paper-level claim
  governance. This is coordination only; no authority token, theorem closure,
  W9 closure, G6 closure, or paper admissibility claim is constructed.
  The worker board now also records the refined phase sequence: immediate
  no-dependency lanes, short-term CT18/W4 intake, medium G2/G3/GR/G6 theorem
  lanes, and final G4/W7 packaging, with the critical path kept as routing
  metadata rather than a promotion claim.

- integrate first non-limited paper closure worker returns:
  the G2, G3, and GR scope modules now contain theorem-kernel obligation
  records for Maxwell sector restriction, Schrodinger evolution/contraction,
  and finite-r GR/Bianchi/matter-coupling work. A new
  `NonLimitedPaperBundleClaimGovernance.agda` module represents the 12-step
  non-limited paper roadmap as typed status fields with computed
  admissibility; the canonical state remains blocked at
  `missingRoadmapGovernance`. These additions are non-promoting and do not
  close G2, G3, GR/G4, G6, W7, W9, the non-limited paper, or full unification.

- integrate remaining non-limited paper closure worker returns:
  governance docs now define a bounded self-issuance policy fork for W2/W3
  evidence classes without populating tokens; the W9 canonical-15 `refl` route
  is refuted by a typed normal-form mismatch (`2` versus `10`); the W4 Z-peak
  anchor run is checksum-bound and records `chi2/dof = 298.8462841768543`
  while keeping accepted DY authority absent; and CT18NLO is recorded as local
  candidate provenance with an expanded LHAPDF/PDF intake contract. These are
  routing and obstruction/authority surfaces only, not W2/W3/W4/W5/W9 or paper
  promotions.

- record W4/W5 LHAPDF intake preflight obstruction:
  `scripts/w4w5_pdf_lhapdf_intake_preflight.py` now emits a fail-closed
  W4/W5 PDF intake artifact. The 2026-05-13 rerun records system LHAPDF
  tooling present (`/usr/bin/lhapdf`, `/usr/bin/lhapdf-config`, and system
  Python `lhapdf` at `6.5.5`) and repo-local CT18NLO resolvable with
  `LHAPDF_DATA_PATH=/usr/share/lhapdf/LHAPDF:$PWD/scripts/data/pdf`. The repo
  `.venv` still lacks the Python `lhapdf` module, no local MSHT20 grid was
  found, and a fresh CT18 equivalent-table candidate packet remains at
  `logs/research/w4w5_pdf_ct18_candidate_run_20260513.json` SHA-256
  `7b4e5e815c3e65619cd9591734eb00e7c80be0402c6d06c3c8d33d1c8da6609f`. The
  provider-authority obstruction artifact is
  `logs/research/w4w5_pdf_lhapdf_intake_obstruction_20260513.json` SHA-256
  `082448674db69767aff1897f7fb66054a6dbc3a70b86f31813185a6a2c10fd41`.
  W4/W5 receipt surfaces and blocker docs cite the obstruction while keeping
  the CT18 numerics candidate-only and non-promoting.

- add corrected CT18 DY luminosity convention diagnostic:
  `scripts/run_w4w5_ct18_corrected_dy_luminosity.py` computes the full-`x`
  charge-weighted `dL/dtau` convention with system LHAPDF and records the
  non-promoting artifact
  `logs/research/w4w5_ct18_corrected_dy_luminosity_20260513.json` SHA-256
  `34d4a317d29b23a39e6d0b865028ba8640059123371dddfdf443e4b0e8ec43a8`.
  The `dtau` mass-window `L(106-170)/L(76-106)` correction is
  `0.9931829614316737`, not target `0.8804486068`; W4/W5 remain blocked on
  `missingAcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority`. A focused pytest regression
  covers the `dx/x` convention.

- sharpen W4 provider calibration-authority surfaces:
  `W4PhysicalUnitAuthorityRequestSurface.agda` now exposes a provider
  response/receipt surface for physical-unit authority and a parameterized
  quotient-sensitive cross-band witness surface over an existing
  `QuotientLawAtWitness canonicalCandidate256QuotientLaw`. The witness surface
  packages the internal TSFV `T` involution, compatibility, positive
  non-collapse, and `T`-flipped non-collapse while preserving the external
  chemistry-law receipt and physical-unit authority blockers. The docs and
  TODO entry mirror the same non-promoting boundary: no
  `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationAuthorityToken`, external calibration
  receipt, or W4 promotion is constructed.

- add DASHI-Markov compatibility surface:
  `Docs/DASHIMarkovCompatibility.md`, `DASHI/Core/DashiMarkov.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Process/DASHIMarkovCompatibility.agda` define Markov structure as a
  downstream projection of a DASHI lane. The native state is the typed joined
  slice of carrier, residual/pressure state, open obligations, accepted
  authorities, admissibility boundary, and promotion status. The Agda surfaces
  record structural transition, history sufficiency, multiscale joined state,
  and optional relation-valued kernel compatibility without adding stochastic
  assumptions, stationarity, HMM/MDP machinery, promotion receipts, or a global
  latent oracle.

- stage canonical HEPData JSON payloads for W3 authority review:
  browser-downloaded HEPData table JSON exports for `t19`, `t20`, `t43`, and
  `t44` are staged under
  `logs/research/provider_inputs/hepdata_ins2079374/` with checksums recorded
  in `checksums.txt`. The active W3 ratio payloads are now hash-bound and
  semantically checked against the local CSV cache: `t43` has `18/18` matching
  ratio rows and `t44` has `324/324` matching total-covariance entries. The W3
  docs and receipt/intake surfaces now record this as canonical-payload
  discovery completed while preserving the no-self-issuance boundary: no
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, accepted external receipt, G5 closure, or
  unification promotion is constructed locally. The W4 physical-unit request
  docs also note that the proton-mass candidate route should use CODATA 2022
  `938.27208943(29) MeV`, not the stale CODATA 2018 value.

- add W3 authority-token governance obstruction audit:
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenGovernanceObstruction.agda` records that the
  landed governance policy permits bounded public-DOI/frozen-commit
  self-issuance only at policy level; the Agda token remains constructorless.
  The exact missing items are the `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`
  constructor/governance hook, `Pack.missingAcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, and
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenReceipt.authorityToken`. The audit also
  records that the non-collapse witness is already represented runner-side by
  `canonicalHEPDataW3T43RunnerPerBinNonCollapseReceipt`, while provider-grade
  external receipt and the authority token remain absent. No W3 promotion or
  accepted external receipt is constructed.

- harden W3 non-collapse runner receipt validation:
  `Docs/W3NonCollapseRunnerReceiptHardening.md`,
  `scripts/check_w3_noncollapse_receipt.py`, and
  `tests/test_w3_noncollapse_receipt.py` now verify that the frozen t43
  comparison JSON checksum, selected bin-12 witness, canonical t43/t44 JSON
  checksums, and Agda runner receipt literals agree. The checker fails closed if
  the local artifact claims provider-grade non-collapse or W3 authority-token /
  external-receipt construction. This confirms runner-side non-collapse is
  complete at the local receipt level, while provider-grade external
  non-collapse and `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` remain absent.

- refresh complete physics-unification roadmap:
  `Docs/CompleteVerifiedPhysicsUnificationRoadmap.md` now records the active
  strict dependency path to a publishable physics-unification claim: internal
  construction, empirical contact, and cross-lane closure/publication audit.
  The roadmap names the current state as one closed gate (`G1`), partial or
  blocked bridge surfaces for `G2`-`G5`, and absent `G6`/`G7` packages. The
  older HEP-R54 fastest-path section is retained only as historical traceability
  and marked superseded. This is documentation/governance only; it adds no
  theorem closure, external authority, promotion receipt, or unification claim.

- add G6 cross-lane commuting theorem skeleton:
  `CrossLaneCommutingTheoremSkeleton.agda` records the typed diagram
  obligation for the common-spine commuting theorem: lane embeddings,
  recovery morphisms, section proofs, and the derived equality chain once
  those sections are supplied. The surface is a record obligation rather than
  top-level postulates and has status `skeletonOnlyNoPromotion`. It does not
  close G6, replace G2/G3/G4/G5, or construct a complete-unification claim.

- wire G6 cross-lane commuting skeleton into roadmap diagrams:
  `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml` and `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now include
  explicit `CrossLaneCommutingTheoremSkeleton` nodes labelled SKELETON /
  no-promotion / postulate-obligation only. The wiring routes G1-G5 inputs
  through the skeleton before the G6/cross-lane consistency target, without
  implying G6 theorem closure or complete unification.

- sharpen accepted DY luminosity convention authority surface:
  `AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthorityReceipt.agda` and the W4/W5 DY
  diagnostic now require luminosity values, efficiency/acceptance model,
  systematic budget, CMS-SMP publication pointer, normalization-preservation
  law, and conversion law in addition to the existing PDF/provenance fields.
  Provider docs and the example JSON mirror the same fail-closed packet shape;
  no W4/W5 promotion or synthetic external authority was added.

- add GRQFT partial consumer receipt:
  `GRQFTConsumerNextObligationV2.agda` now inhabits a partial consumer receipt
  for internally adaptable carriers: spacetime from the known-limits GR bridge
  carrier, wave state from the known-limits QFT bridge, a spinor adapter over
  that wave-state carrier, and the internal gauge-representation carrier. The
  request pack records this V2 partial receipt as reusable input while keeping
  stress-energy, curvature/Einstein laws, interaction closure, PDF authority,
  empirical validation, promotion authority, and full `GRQFTClosurePromotionReceipt`
  external-gated.

## 2026-05-12

- add W2 canonical pressure / realization-metric P2 obstruction:
  `W2CanonicalPressureMetricP2BridgeOrObstruction.agda` defines the explicit
  offline-L2 admissible `Nat -> Nat` candidate family from the canonical
  pressure scalar to the inhabited realization-indexed metric scalar and
  returns `W2KillEvidence` as an obstruction. The obstruction consumes
  `CanonicalP2OfflineL2ObstructionCertificate`; every admissible candidate
  would need the below-delta p2-key forcing bridge that certificate rejects.
  This does not construct `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken` or a
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionReceipt`.

- add LILA-R4 Theta/J bridge citation boundary:
  `LilaE8ThetaJBridgeSurface.agda` records a cross-language
  `LeanSiblingCitationReceipt` for `../dashi_lean4/MoonshineEarn.lean`
  after the exact requested `../dashilean4/MoonshineEarn.lean` path was not
  present. The receipt binds SHA-256
  `62343c34a138a66e5374c17ee92b07104023b1c13d651f56ea17ab2e271d268a` and
  names discovered Moonshine/Ramanujan Lean theorems, but asserts no Lean proof
  in Agda and gives no LILA-R5, W3, G5, physics, or unification promotion.

- add Drosophila Release 6 genome W4 candidate packet:
  downloaded the NCBI `GCF_000001215.4` genomic FASTA and CDS FASTA, added a
  reproducible extractor, and emitted a checksum-bound authority/codon packet.
  `DrosophilaGenomeW4CandidateAuthorityReceipt.agda` records the corrected
  Release 6 reference DOI `10.1101/gr.185579.114`, rejects the previously
  suggested `10.1126/science.1237175` for this route, binds the genomic FASTA
  SHA-256
  `e69e907b5e87ce756236dcef93e82001cfd08f1a0ed5f22e36cbbd3a87ebc57d`, binds
  the CDS FASTA SHA-256
  `3f379cec1d952f9a1c22e2b6dd9ff8eefce6da97ffb198cde93dc0a17c40da01`, and
  records a CDS-based non-uniform codon witness. This remains candidate-only:
  no TSFV calibration law, Candidate256 authority token, Candidate256 physical
  calibration receipt, W4 promotion, Brain promotion, or unification claim was
  constructed.

- add Brain proviso and physics-boundary audit tranche:
  the Brain lane is now explicitly conditional rather than permanently
  ontologically excluded. `BrainGovernanceProviso.agda` keeps Brain/physics
  promotion flags false and allows lateral support review only after typed
  exhaustion of a direct W1-W6 lane with no retarget availability.
  New docs record W1-W6 assignability, Brain-to-physics boundary handles,
  W4/W5's accepted-DY convention blocker, and W2/W9 promotion-boundary blockers.
  The result is non-promoting: Brain evidence does not replace W1-W6 kill
  conditions, does not construct W2/W9/W4/W5 authority, and does not support a
  physics-promotion or unification claim.

- orchestrate W3/W4/W7/W8/W2/W9 plus dashiBRAIN integration lanes:
  W7 bounded claim-governance and W8 first empirical gate were audited and
  already typecheck without edits. W4 Z-peak data and runner wiring were
  verified, producing the existing negative adequacy artifact
  `chi2/dof = 298.8462841768543`; W4 remains blocked on dirty Z-peak shape
  adequacy / accepted DY convention, not missing t21/t22 files. W2 targeted
  surfaces now typecheck under 30s; the active blocker is the constructorless
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionAuthorityToken`, with the p2 bridge still named
  as a downstream technical ingredient. W9 now records that the canonical pair
  route is typed-obstructed and the weighted-support route is accepted-only
  until a W9 kill-route constructor consumes it. The Drosophila hemibrain lane
  now has non-promoting external numeric receipts, a checksum manifest,
  single-scale closure/gauge robustness receipts, and a typed coarse-grain
  persistence obstruction. No W3 authority token, W4 calibration, W8 external
  origin authority, W2 promotion, W9 kill receipt, Brain promotion, physics
  promotion, or unification claim was constructed.

## 2026-05-06

- add evidence-decision forcing artifacts:
  DY authority intake now has a provider response checklist and a syntactically
  valid example authority packet that intentionally fails closed as
  `insufficient`. The DY luminosity adapter smoke artifact records absent
  packet exit `50`, insufficient authority exit `51`, and accepted-shaped
  temporary fixture exit `0` while preserving `computed-not-promoted` status.
  W3 now has a provider response checklist; Candidate256 minimal missing
  fields are reduced to W4-derived values plus one external calibration
  authority payload; the Einstein candidate interface has a guarded patch plan;
  and the limited SM+GR paper readiness matrix maps receipts to paper sections,
  allowed claims, forbidden claims, blockers, and next actions. No authority
  token, W4/W5 promotion, Candidate256 calibration, stress-energy receipt,
  Einstein law, GRQFT validation, or limited-unification claim was constructed.

## 2026-05-05

- add submission and compatibility readiness artifacts:
  final provider-facing submission bundles now exist for the W4/W5 accepted DY
  luminosity convention and the W3 accepted evidence authority token. A shared
  DY luminosity adapter consumes accepted/replacement authority-shaped JSON and
  emits W4/W5 luminosity artifacts while failing closed without provider
  authority and luminosities. New claim-boundary and compatibility audit docs
  keep Level 1/2/3 publication language, Candidate256 calibration, and W4
  matter/stress-energy downstream of inhabited receipts. No authority token,
  W4/W5 promotion, calibration receipt, stress-energy receipt, Einstein law, or
  GRQFT promotion was constructed.

- assign receipt-ingestion and downstream-readiness lanes:
  six non-promoting lanes now prepare the next handoff layer after the DY
  provider packet. New response-ingestion surfaces exist for accepted DY
  luminosity authority and W3 accepted evidence authority; W4 and W5 now have
  fail-closed runner/receipt templates gated on accepted provider packets;
  Candidate256 physical calibration and W4 matter/stress-energy now have
  explicit preflight contracts. No W4 adequacy, W5 pass, W3 token,
  Candidate256 calibration, stress-energy receipt, GR law, or GRQFT promotion
  was constructed.

- add DY convention authority provider packet:
  `Docs/AcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthorityProviderPacket.md` now
  externalizes the W4/W5 accepted Drell-Yan luminosity convention request in a
  sendable form. It names the required PDF, LHAPDF, checksum, scale, rapidity,
  mass-bin, flavour, integration, source, and provenance fields, preserves the
  failed fixed-`x`, `t45/z_peak`, and `t45/t43` probes as negative diagnostics,
  and keeps W4/W5 non-promoting until an accepted authority receipt exists.

- run six-lane limited SM+GR authority/gate follow-up:
  W4/W5 accepted DY convention surfaces now canonicalize
  `missingAcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority` and the shared
  `missingSharedAcceptedDYLuminosityConventionAuthority` without promoting
  W4/W5. `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenIntakeRequest.agda` now exposes the
  provider-facing token field and preserves the constructorless
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` boundary. W4 physical calibration,
  matter/stress-energy, discrete Einstein-law, and GRQFT/QFT consumer lanes now
  preserve their downstream order: accepted DY convention authority, W4
  adequacy, `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceipt`, W4 matter/stress
  energy, discrete Einstein law, and GRQFT validation. No authority token,
  calibration receipt, stress-energy receipt, Einstein-law receipt, or GRQFT
  closure promotion was constructed.

- assign limited SM+GR unification paper tranche:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` now records orchestrator id
  `limited-sm-gr-unification-2026-05-05` with six highest-gain lanes toward a
  limited known-limit SM+GR paper claim: W3 accepted authority, W4/W5 accepted
  Drell-Yan luminosity convention, W4 physical calibration, W4-derived
  matter/stress-energy, discrete Einstein law, and QFT/GRQFT consumer
  validation. `TODO.md` mirrors the same promotion guards: no synthetic
  authority tokens, no W4/W5 close without accepted convention/provenance, no
  GR promotion before W4 matter/stress-energy, and no limited SM+GR claim
  without GR equation law plus QFT/GRQFT consumer validation.

- integrate limited SM+GR unification worker lanes:
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenIntakeRequest.agda` now contains a final
  request-only provider-facing handoff packet. W4/W5 convention and PDF intake
  surfaces now make accepted DY luminosity/bin-integration authority the exact
  shared first missing item. W4 physical calibration surfaces now keep
  `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceipt` downstream of accepted
  PDF-backed W4 adequacy. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` now exposes
  `missingW4AnchorArtifactReceiptForMatterStress` and packages the future
  discrete Einstein-law consumer payload. GRQFT request/diagnostic surfaces now
  include the empirical validation receipt payload tied to `grEquationLaw` and
  `qftInteractionLaw`. No authority token, W4/W5 promotion, GR promotion, or
  GRQFT closure promotion was constructed.

- clarify Wikidata global-latent formalism:
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`,
  `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` now distinguish the formal endstate
  from current repo/runtime state. The formalism is recorded as monotone
  structural coherence over a snapshot-derived global ontology index; bounded
  QID diagnostics and review packets are local projections. The remaining gaps
  are still explicit: QID/PID/statement carriers, live/global ontology index,
  mutation/filter carriers, QID-only repair projection, global severity theorem,
  and governance-token surfaces. No edit authority, runtime receipt, or P0
  promotion was constructed.

- assign Wikidata monotone structural coherence worker lanes:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` now records orchestrator id
  `wikidata-monotone-coherence-2026-05-05` with four read-only docs/governance
  sidecar lanes for the pasted formalism: residual-core Agda gap analysis,
  ontology-index and bounded-slice surface scan, docs/governance placement,
  and validation policy. `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` now reflect the same non-promoting boundary: no
  Wikidata edit authority without external promotion receipt, no fabricated
  runtime `PNFEmissionReceipt`, no assumed live dump/index, and no monotonicity
  theorem without the filter-respecting edit-stream precondition.

- attempt CT18NLO PDF intake:
  direct `lhapdf` installation was unavailable (`pip` has no wheel in the
  repo-local virtualenv), so the public CT18NLO LHAPDF grid was downloaded to
  `scripts/data/pdf/`. Added `scripts/extract_ct18_pdf_packet.py` to parse the
  `lhagrid1` central member without LHAPDF runtime bindings and emit
  `scripts/data/pdf/ct18_dashi_pdf_packet.json`. The archive digest is
  `c9127231e77e97cbec79cb5839203ab00f8db77237a061b61f9420f2b7b9c213`; the
  central grid digest is
  `375db856d2f8c7087a626c92ebf228d3f080e5de83175519778ffaf6e72e5410`. The
  local fixed-`x = 0.01` extraction gives W5 correction
  `1.0506681065158017`, not `0.8804486068`, so W4/W5 remain blocked on an
  accepted parton-luminosity/bin-integration convention and authority route,
  not on missing CT18 grid data. Updated the W4/W5 and W5 intake Agda surfaces
  accordingly; no W4/W5 promotion or PDF carrier was constructed.

- assign next-six blocker parallel tranche:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` now records orchestrator id
  `next-six-blockers-2026-05-05` with six disjoint lanes: W4/W5 shared PDF
  intake, W9 theorem-interface bridge, W3 authority-token audit, W2
  promotion-token audit, W4 calibration/matter-source queue, and GR
  Einstein-law queue. `W4W5PDFSharedDependencyDiagnostic.agda` and
  `W5PDFCarrierExternalIntakeRequest.agda` now include exact PDF packet
  precision fields, local no-LHAPDF audit facts, and W4/W5 extraction
  contracts. `W4PhysicalCalibrationObligationSurface.agda` now records the
  post-PDF chain from shared PDF-backed Z-peak adequacy to external physical
  calibration, `matterFieldFromW4`, and `stressEnergyTensorFromW4`. W9, W3,
  W2, and GR returned no-change audits that preserve the current blockers and
  construct no promotions or authority tokens.

- record merged W4/W5 PDF dependency:
  `W4W5PDFSharedDependencyDiagnostic.agda` now records that W4 dirty Z-peak
  shape adequacy and W5 t45 correction share the same upstream
  CT18/MSHT/LHAPDF-compatible parton-luminosity intake. The diagnostic binds
  the current W4 failed shape fit (`chi2/dof = 298.8462841768543`, digest
  `36191efc92cb3c9b1641c9206171a307c4796369a4acd1485bf87d1051662b8b`) and
  the W5 required correction `0.8804486068`, while explicitly constructing no
  W4 anchor closure, W4 promotion, W5 t45 promotion, or external PDF carrier.
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` imports the new diagnostic for
  discoverability.
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` additionally records
  that the proposed `pressure <= wQcoreBound^2` theorem is not accepted by the
  current W9 kill constructors without a typed bridge into the theorem-facing
  pair transport. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` now places the merged W4/W5
  PDF intake before future W4 matter-field/stress-energy receipts. W4 Z-peak
  diagnostics also record that no local CSS momentum-space/qT artifact with
  chi2/dof approximately `65` is present.

- integrate Z-peak/W9 theorem next-six assignment:
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` now supports a governed dirty Z-peak
  shape-fit path: a declared uncalibrated t21 shape callable is fitted with
  one covariance-weighted scalar and the scalar is emitted as calibration
  metadata. `DASHI.Physics.Prediction.sigma_dashi:predict_dirty_z_peak_shape`
  wires the existing finite `sigma_DASHI` construction into that path without
  claiming upstream `pb` units. The current fit is inadequate
  (`chi2/dof = 298.8462841768543`, scale `230534508.31238452`), so
  `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda` and
  `W4ZPeakCalibrationAnchorReceipt.agda` move the W4 first missing item to
  shape adequacy rather than calibration-anchor closure.
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` now records
  that the weighted-Qcore route still depends on the obstructed
  cancellation-pressure to weighted-quadratic identification at `(one , one)`,
  so W9 remains blocked. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` adds the future
  `W4MatterStressEnergyInterfaceReceipt` shape and records W4 calibration
  authority as the post-anchor GR gate. W2, W3, and W5 were audited as
  no-change external/governance blockers.

- integrate W9/W4/governance/PDF tranche:
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` now records the
  concrete canonical-15 counterexample and rejects the proposed canonical-state
  `refl` close. W4 public t21/t22 artifacts are now local with SHA-256 digests
  and parser-visible schema; the dirty Z-peak path parses the 18-bin
  measurement and 18 x 18 covariance matrix, then fails closed at the missing
  `compute_dashi_ratio` prediction API. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` now
  orders the W4-gated GR queue as anchor, calibration authority, matter field,
  stress-energy tensor, then discrete Einstein-equation law.
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenIntakeRequest.agda` is packet-complete for
  external authority review but constructs no token.
  `W2GovernanceSelfIssuanceIntakeRequest.agda` records the W2 governance
  closing packet while keeping self-issuance unavailable.
  `W5CT18ExternalIntakeReceipt.agda` records the CT18/MSHT/LHAPDF packet fields
  required before W5 can consume the external PDF carrier.

- integrate W9/Qcore + W4/GR governance assignment round:
  `W9CancellationPressureQcoreCompatibilityReceipt.agda` rejects the proposed
  W9 close in the actual repo types: the available weighted-support theorem is
  a `Nat` inequality, while the current W9 kill route still needs the
  canonical-15 `ℤ` pressure-to-contraction-energy equality, which remains
  obstructed. `EinsteinEquationCandidate.agda` records GR as a W4-gated
  `G_mu_nu = 8pi T_mu_nu` obligation surface with matter coupling first
  missing, not as a curved-GR promotion. `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda`
  and `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` add a fail-closed dirty Z-peak CLI path
  for future t21/t22 runs, while preserving the missing-artifact and schema
  boundary. `W2W3SelfIssuanceGovernanceRulingDiagnostic.agda` records that W2
  and W3 remain blocked by constructorless authority tokens unless governance
  policy is explicitly amended.

- integrate Lyapunov-adapter / external-gap audit round:
  `W9LyapunovAdapterReceipt.agda` constructs a narrow
  `CancellationPressureLyapunovBridge` for `NormalizeAddState` using
  `carryDepth + carryBudget`, while
  `W9LyapunovIncompatibilityDiagnostic.agda` preserves the remaining dim-15
  pressure/Qcore blocker as
  `ExistingCancellationPressureCompatibilityObligation canonical15Theorem
  canonical15Dimension`. `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda`
  now records the no-network local audit of missing t21/t22 artifacts and the
  t43/t44-only runner interface. `W5PDFCarrierExternalConfirmedGap.agda`
  records that the local DGLAP/LO plus carrier-correction route is still
  insufficient and that CT18/MSHT/LHAPDF intake remains required.
  `DiscreteConnectionCandidateFromCRT.agda` records a diagnostic-only
  CRT-to-connection first-missing surface, with no asymptotic, Bianchi, or
  curved-GR promotion claim.

- integrate constructorless-token / retarget audit round:
  `W2PromotionAuthorityReceipt.agda` now consumes local uniform-rate support
  while preserving the constructorless W2 promotion authority boundary.
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityTokenIntakeRequest.agda` records the HEP-R55
  token-only external intake request and explicitly rejects local
  self-issuance. `W5PDFCarrierExternalIntakeRequest.agda` records absent local
  LHAPDF tooling and tightens the external provider payload. W9 now has
  `W9WeightedSupportRetargetConsumerReceipt.agda`, a non-promoting weighted
  support retarget-consumer acceptance receipt, while
  `W9LyapunovIncompatibilityDiagnostic.agda` keeps W9 blocked on the missing
  Lyapunov bridge. `DiscreteEinsteinTensorCandidate.agda` records that CRT/J
  p47/p59/p71 surfaces do not yet supply a carrier-internal non-flat
  connection.

- integrate W2/W3/GR fanout round:
  `UniformConvergenceRateSurface.agda` records the fixed local
  `NormalizeAddState` / `normalizeAdd` rate surface; `W2PromotionAuthorityReceipt.agda`
  records that W2 remains blocked on constructorless authority and
  carrier-general convergence packaging. `W4ZPeakCalibrationAnchorReceipt.agda`
  records missing t21/t22 artifacts and the t43/t44 runner boundary.
  `W9LyapunovIncompatibilityDiagnostic.agda` records that the weighted support
  bound is not a current Lyapunov/retarget consumer.
  `DiscreteEinsteinTensorCandidate.agda` records a flat-only GR candidate with
  first missing `missingNonFlatConnectionOrShift`. W7 bounded scope now includes
  W2 sum-invariance and Minkowski flat-space while excluding unification.
  `W5PDFCarrierExternalIntakeRequest.agda` records the missing external PDF
  carrier for required t45 correction `0.8804486068`.

- land W2 sum-invariance and GR flat-space receipts:
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/NormalizeAddSumPreservation.agda` proves by `refl` that
  `normalizeAdd` preserves `lhs + rhs` and the p-adic valuation of that sum for
  every tracked prime. `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda` now
  carries that positive invariant instead of the timeout-prone candidate-family
  imports. `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MinkowskiLimitReceipt.agda` records the
  exact hyperbolic/Minkowski quadratic and the B4 intrinsic `sig31` match.
  These are theorem receipts, but W2 kill promotion still awaits the existing
  constructorless authority token and carrier-general convergence-rate
  packaging; curved GR recovery remains open.

- integrate fastest-path sidecar results:
  W5 now has `PDFCarrierLogRatioDiagnostic.agda`, threaded into
  `GRQFTConsumerNextObligation.agda`, recording required t45 correction
  `0.8804486068` versus proxy `0.8751733190` while preserving
  `externallyPDFGated` status. W6 returned provider-ready with no edit because
  the existing runtime request pack already names the five payload fields. GR
  remains a diagnostic discrete metric/curvature target, not a recovery
  theorem. W2 returned a positive candidate-family first step, but W0 held it
  out of integration because the targeted `30s` Agda check exits `124`.

- launch the fastest-path-to-completion round:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`,
  `Docs/CompleteVerifiedPhysicsUnificationRoadmap.md`, and `TODO.md` now
  record that W2 is the critical-path fork for complete unification. `Turing` /
  `Cicero` (`019df414-e48e-7392-8e3d-30ca8e51b017`) owns the W2 positive
  natural `p2` candidate-family / bridge attempt. `Maxwell` / `Goodall`
  (`019df414-e56e-71a0-83ca-aa345005bdeb`) owns the W5 PDF-carrier correction
  diagnostic, `Liskov` / `Pauli`
  (`019df414-e65a-7542-a678-129149edb11c`) owns W6 runtime PNF readiness, and
  `Gauss` / `Darwin` (`019df414-e7c8-7d73-b059-d06de4839363`) owns the GR
  metric-recovery weakest-sufficient-target sidecar. HEP-R55/W3 is left as
  external provider engagement for `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`.

- launch the first-missing formalism alignment round:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now assign W2 to `Turing` /
  `Hubble` (`019df410-7c68-7a80-a5be-466f6c3294ac`), W3 authority-token
  readiness to `Curie-Authority` / `Harvey`
  (`019df410-b29b-72b2-89da-45f70210360a`), W4 calibration alignment to
  `Faraday` / `Lovelace` (`019df410-80d5-7350-9981-eec179ea3c9b`), W5
  GRQFT/PDF closure alignment to `Maxwell` / `Newton`
  (`019df410-9402-73d2-acbb-f1caf7984ee5`), and W9 dim-15/retarget alignment
  to `Planck` / `Archimedes`
  (`019df410-9dff-79e3-bfda-42a67a86d250`). This round aligns proposed
  standalone formalisms with existing typed surfaces; it does not reopen
  HEP-R53 W3 non-collapse, fabricate authority/calibration/PDF receipts, or
  construct W2/W9 theorems.

- integrate first-missing formalism alignment results:
  W2 required no duplicate module because `NaturalP2BridgeOrObstructionReceipt`
  and the W2 kill condition already cover the requested bridge/obstruction
  formalism. W3 accepted-authority provider wording now records HEP-R55 as
  external-only for `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`. W4 adds
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationObligationSurface.agda`, a non-promoting aggregation
  naming `missingSameRecordT21T22ArtifactReceipt` as first missing while
  preserving the calibration authority boundary. W5 required no duplicate
  module because existing GRQFT/PDF request and diagnostic surfaces already
  cover the proposed formalism. W9 adds `Dim15DeltaToQuadraticObligation` in
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda`, naming the two
  surviving routes: dim-15 pressure-witness theorem or downstream retarget
  consumer acceptance.

- update W7 post-HEP-R53 publishable-scope governance:
  `ClaimGovernancePromotionObligation.agda` now binds the bounded W3 t43
  comparison-law receipt to the HEP-R53 runner-side non-collapse receipt. The
  exact admissible claim is formal carrier plus no-free-parameter below-Z t43
  phistar ratio comparison, `50-76 / 76-106 GeV`, `chi2/dof =
  2.1565191176`, and runner-side non-collapse witness. This is not complete
  unification, not full W3 accepted authority before HEP-R54, and not closure
  of W2, W4, W5, W6, W8, or W9.

- launch the HEP-R54 / publishable-scope sidecar round:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now assign `Curie-W3` /
  `Confucius` (`019df40b-48e3-7291-b872-edcd5744cb71`) to the W3 accepted
  authority assembly attempt, `Arendt` / `Kant`
  (`019df40b-4a39-74f0-93d3-36973dc08e56`) to W7 bounded publishable-scope
  governance, and `Faraday-Hypatia` / `Ampere`
  (`019df40b-4b45-7453-9db4-ecfcc11eaf3d`) to W4/W8 sidecar status after
  HEP-R53. This is a coordination update only; no accepted authority token,
  W4 calibration, W8 origin authority, W2 theorem, W9 kill receipt, or full
  unification claim is constructed.

- integrate HEP-R54 / publishable-scope sidecar results:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityProviderAttempt.agda` now consumes HEP-R51/R52/R53 and
  records `missingAcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` as the first missing
  authority provider field; no `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` or
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceipt` is constructed. W7 governance now
  records the honest bounded publishable claim after HEP-R53: below-Z Drell-Yan
  phistar t43, formal carrier plus no-free-parameter comparison, `chi2/dof =
  2.1565191176`, and runner-side non-collapse evidence, explicitly not full
  unification or full W3 accepted authority. W8 origin request surfaces now
  list HEP-R53 as support evidence only, not origin authority. W4 remains
  blocked on same-record t21/t22 artifacts and Z-peak runner support.

- land HEP-R53 per-bin output and W3 t43 non-collapse witness receipt:
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` now emits a `per_bin` payload containing
  per-bin prediction, data, covariance-diagonal uncertainty, and pull.
  `HEPDataW3NonCollapseWitnessReceipt.agda` records the runner-side t43
  non-collapse witness: bin `12`, prediction `0.0486590199823977`, data
  `0.049758`, uncertainty `0.00048197510309143566`, pull
  `-2.280159308132989`. The new artifact
  `/tmp/t43_clean_freeze_v2.json` has SHA-256
  `3987f82678943bab7679a9948e865f74f2263cdbe38a0e997734dad38939fda0` and
  projection digest
  `cc6ea1a8ea57ef376ae275c1b49e32b27d6d204d7b70cad5c6308b3f8a897a79`.
  Prediction bins are stable against the prior checksum-bound artifact, and
  covariance recomputation gives `chi2/dof = 2.1565191176275613`. HEP-R54
  accepted-authority assembly is now the next W3 action; no constructorless
  authority token or `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceipt` is fabricated here.

- record the W3 and W9 next-priority diagnostics:
  `W3T43AuthorityPacketCandidateDiagnostic.agda` records the checksum-bound
  t43 authority-packet candidate and strongest fallback residual witness
  candidate from `/tmp/t43_clean_freeze.json`, while explicitly noting that the
  artifact lacks `per_bin` and therefore cannot construct
  `nonCollapseWitnessReceipt`, `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken`, or
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceipt`.
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` records
  `currentW9RetargetConsumerAbsenceDiagnostic`, showing no in-repo downstream
  retarget consumer or acceptance receipt exists. These are non-promoting
  diagnostics only.

- land the W2 Path B Offline L2 insufficiency diagnostic:
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda` now records
  `canonicalOfflineL2InsufficientForConvergenceRate`, tying the existing
  `CanonicalP2OfflineL2ObstructionCertificate` to the convergence-rate
  obligation. The result is explicitly non-promoting: Offline L2 proves that
  below-delta normalized-shadow candidates cannot force the canonical `p2` key,
  so it does not supply carrier transport, rate preservation, uniform
  realization evidence, or a positive p2-key schedule bridge. W2 remains
  blocked with a sharper first-missing lift diagnostic.

- record the W4 Z-peak dirty-boundary support diagnostic:
  `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda` now records that the
  requested same-record t21/t22 dirty boundary check is blocked locally because
  `scripts/data/hepdata` lacks the t21 measurement and t22 covariance CSVs, and
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` is currently a t43/t44 runner rather than a
  generic `--mode` / `--data` / `--covariance` runner. No numeric Z-peak
  anchor, calibration authority, physical unit carrier, dimensional law, or W4
  promotion is constructed.

- launch the next-priority worker round:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` now record the live
  assignments for W3 authority-packet preparation (`Curie-W3` / `Kuhn`,
  `019df3fb-f403-7301-a6b6-abd8ffae6a19`), W2 Offline L2 sufficiency
  (`Turing` / `Mendel`, `019df3fb-f520-78f0-9d47-5e718b1c59ac`), W4 Z-peak
  anchor preparation (`Faraday` / `Meitner`,
  `019df3fb-f611-7f82-9ab3-3596152f70f1`), and W9 retarget consumer scan
  (`Planck` / `Einstein`, `019df3fb-f7f7-7903-be2a-57d29bc2832f`). This is a
  coordination update only: no W3 accepted authority receipt, W2 theorem, W4
  calibration receipt, or W9 kill receipt is constructed.

- resolve the W2 Natural p2 convergence isolation timeout:
  `CanonicalScheduleIndependentNaturalChargeNextIngredientGap.agda` now keeps
  the p2 key, schedule admissibility, closure dynamics, and richer invariant
  unlock claims behind an abstract gap boundary. This preserves the landed base
  natural-charge law, widening obstruction, and p2 schedule-bridge obstruction
  fields while avoiding normalization of the concrete carrier/fibre proof spine
  during W2 governance checks. `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda`
  now exports the canonical
  `NaturalP2BridgeCarrierGeneralConvergenceObstruction` under `timeout 30s`
  validation. No natural p2 bridge, promotion authority, or carrier-general
  convergence receipt is constructed.

- sharpen the W4 same-record Z-peak calibration-anchor request:
  `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda` now includes a typed
  `W4SameRecordZPeakT21T22ArtifactReceiptRequest` for the t21 measurement and
  t22 covariance anchors, with DOI equalities, requested checksum/header/bin
  fields, and a non-promotion request boundary.
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceiptRequestPack.agda` adds the matching
  provider payload requirement. This is request/diagnostic progress only:
  no `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationAuthorityToken`, physical unit carrier,
  dimensional preservation proof, ratio-calibration law, or W4 promotion is
  constructed.

- sharpen W6 runtime PNF provider diagnostic:
  `PNFResidualConsumerNextObligation.agda` now names missing
  receipt-backed residual computation as an explicit missing runtime source,
  and `PNFResidualConsumerRuntimeProviderAttempt.agda` exports the canonical
  provider output as diagnostic-only. No concrete consumer profile, runtime
  receipt id, paired `PNFEmissionReceipt` values, residual computation, or
  Hecke candidate-pool receipt id is fabricated.

- add W3 residual observable-class receipt/proto alignment:
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassReceiptProtoAlignment.agda` records the typed
  W3 residual-closure output for Curie-W3. The local `phistar_50_76` proto
  receipt is aligned to the provider-facing `residualObservableClassReceipt`
  slot and may be returned as the first-missing typed diagnostic, but it remains
  unaccepted: residual payload intake still rejects at
  `firstMissingResidualObservableClass`, the residual authority gate remains
  blocked, `nonCollapseWitnessReceipt` is still a later missing receipt, and no
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceipt` or W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion is constructed.
- sharpen W5 GRQFT/PDF carrier diagnostics:
  `GRQFTConsumerNextObligation.agda` now treats the external PDF
  carrier/mass-kernel route as a first-class missing upstream field and
  carries a non-promoting `GRQFTPDFCarrierPrerequisiteDiagnostic`.
  `GRQFTConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` marks that prerequisite source as
  missing, and `GRQFTClosurePromotionReceiptRequestPack.agda` adds it to the
  exact provider payload request. No PDF carrier, promotion authority, GR/QFT
  law, witness, empirical validation, or closure-promotion receipt is
  constructed.
- hold the W2 Natural p2 convergence output for isolation:
  the W2 worker output is not included in the safe-lane integration because
  `timeout 30s agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda`
  timed out while checking
  `CanonicalScheduleIndependentNaturalChargeNextIngredientGap.agda` through the
  import chain. W2 remains pending a bounded isolation round before its typed
  obstruction is committed.
- assign the W3-promoted residual closure lanes:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` now records
  `w3-promoted-residual-closure-2026-05-05` as the active orchestrator handoff
  for the remaining gates. `Noether` audits W1's unblocked final seam,
  `Turing` owns W2 p2/rate, `Curie-W3` owns W3 authority plus residual
  observable class, `Faraday` owns W4 calibration/Z-peak/cross-band witness,
  `Maxwell` owns W5 GRQFT/PDF carrier, `Liskov` owns W6 runtime PNF intake,
  `Arendt` owns W7 claim governance, `Hypatia` owns W8 first-empirical-gate
  origin recording, and `Planck` owns W9 dim-15 pressure compatibility. This
  is a coordination update only and constructs no missing external receipt,
  authority token, calibration token, runtime payload, or W2/W9 theorem.
- record the first W3-promoted residual closure results:
  `OriginReceiptPromotionExternalObligation.agda` now contains
  `OriginReceiptPromotionFirstGateSatisfiedReceipt`, tying the bounded HEP-R52
  W3 t43 comparison-law receipt to W8's first empirical gate while preserving
  `empiricalBlocked` for the current origin receipt and leaving
  `OriginReceiptPromotionExternalReceipt` external. `ClaimGovernancePromotionObligation.agda`
  now contains `BoundedW3T43ClaimGovernancePromotionReceipt`, documenting the
  bounded publishable scope for below-Z Drell-Yan phistar ratio
  `50-76 / 76-106 GeV`, t43 lane, `chi2/dof = 2.1565191176`, clean
  deterministic carrier, no posterior tuning, and no external PDF.
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` indexes HEP-R51 and HEP-R52. The W1 audit
  confirmed the final seam is already landed and
  `w1KillCondition.currentState = unblocked`; W2, W3 residual authority, W4,
  W5, W6, and W9 remain open.
- add HEP-R45 observable-definition receipt:
  `HEPDataObservableDefinitionReceipt.agda` records the local t43/t44 and
  t45/t46 HEPData CSV header facts as a non-promoting receipt. Both ratio
  value tables use `DSIG/DPHISTAR / DSIG/DPHISTAR`: t43 is measured
  differential cross section in `50 <= Mll < 76` divided by `76 <= Mll < 106`,
  and t45 is `106 <= Mll < 170` divided by `76 <= Mll < 106`. The values are
  not normalized by bin width, and the normalized-by-total-cross-section
  hypothesis is blocked. Added `scripts/diagnose_hepdata_ratio_conventions.py`
  to print the table DOI/name/description/observable and ratio ranges; local
  output gives t43 min/max/mean `0.036572` / `0.078012` / `0.0469034` and t45
  min/max/mean `0.020919` / `0.030239` / `0.0262884`. This is diagnostic only:
  no accepted comparison law, empirical adequacy, or W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R43/HEP-R44 mass-window-general prediction diagnostics:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi_mass_general.py` is a fresh
  non-promoting predictor that does not encode the HEP-R41 t43
  residual-shape response. `HEPDataMassWindowGeneralPredictionLawDiagnostic.agda`
  records the corrected obligation after the t45 holdout failure: t44 is
  covariance-only, and the next law must predict both `50-76 / 76-106` and
  `106-170 / 76-106` without observed-table tuning. Dirty runs of the fresh
  predictor failed both targets: t43 artifact
  `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r43_mass_general_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `235e289e79d9aca474fbb16ddf8dd11359ff4c9e807d07d032e4e9e15dedb359`,
  projection digest
  `ba9b9f821d1a17ab3c3d9f175081f260665efc5ebc795bedcb2a5479700c678d`,
  and chi2/dof `1770377.845008375`; t45 artifact
  `/tmp/t45_projection_hep_r43_mass_general_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `301c64668a47404b0bc8d75ce79542795f974633ce3fb02df4e851b8be503171`,
  projection digest
  `8adc2d9d5cc764123be371b3d428169356579802b77be46847ea5bfeb6bc5927`,
  and chi2/dof `122.01665676644487`. `HEPDataMassWindowGeneralPredictionRunDiagnostic.agda`
  records this as a model-gap diagnostic only: no accepted comparison law,
  empirical adequacy, or W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R42 t45/t46 independent holdout diagnostic:
  checksum-bound holdout artifacts were added for HEPData t45
  (`bcc1450c5c7818e2792f06f1882c6facdea2e4079070b777f2c5ac3b87343433`)
  and t46
  (`e325d82ec3ba6962042c54f6b98a911d456f9bf00db22d2238b0cd76e71dcb3f`).
  `DASHI.Physics.Prediction.sigma_dashi` now exposes
  `predict_ratio_106_170_over_76_106` for the unchanged HEP-R41 model.
  The dirty holdout artifact `/tmp/t45_projection_hep_r42_holdout_dirty.json`
  has SHA-256
  `60242829cd37a9508c1b21da969c43383c1e00f6e4b6c77457ee5d1a67e2b4e3`,
  projection digest
  `2ac58b6d7c16384769dae42be2877c0025797acacc730f9d9443b00e538bda25`,
  and chi2/dof `222.54402462995546`. `HEPDataT45HoldoutValidationDiagnostic.agda`
  records this as an independent holdout failure, proving the HEP-R41 t43
  numeric pass is not a general empirical adequacy receipt.
- add HEP-R41 posterior shape-response diagnostic:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi.py` now includes a posterior
  shoulder-dip / recovery-bump response after HEP-R40 residual inspection.
  The dirty artifact `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r41_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `61bdfa327ee79a8979fe28c932ddf3f39052adc23aa94ef9b070c9ccfcafc905`,
  projection digest
  `4f131476a22ea8b9315370378f106e19c044964335f0b4a1a7d6e846e90ee336`,
  and covariance-aware chi2/dof `1.7408778006026118`.
  `HEPDataT43PosteriorShapeResponseDiagnostic.agda` records this as
  numeric-pass / governance-fail only: posterior residual-shape tuning,
  synthetic dirty freeze, no accepted comparison law, no empirical adequacy,
  and no W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R40 neutral-current continuum refinement diagnostic:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi.py` now includes a bounded diagnostic
  gamma/Z neutral-current continuum factor over the HEP-R39 v2 construction.
  The dirty artifact `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r40_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `7772bad5b8bdc7407b6432d8fe7585fb7ed357f6eed3db4e3d6883c9c1cffac6`,
  projection digest
  `96be51a8019b7fcd88e36def0d61fd483c9b3bfe4a1698c9cce6079188567ff9`,
  and covariance-aware chi2/dof `28.65761549390974`.
  `HEPDataT43NeutralCurrentContinuumRefinementDiagnostic.agda` records the
  result as another model-gap reduction only: synthetic dirty freeze, no
  accepted comparison law, no empirical adequacy, and no W3/W4/W5/W8
  promotion.
- add HEP-R39 sigma_DASHI v2 model-gap refinement diagnostic:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi.py` now uses a phi-star-dependent
  carrier depth, Breit-Wigner mass-window normalization, and smooth
  finite-carrier phase measure while preserving no observed t43 ratio seeding,
  no covariance input, and no promotion claims.
  `HEPDataT43SigmaDASHIModelGapRefinementDiagnostic.agda` records both the
  HEP-R38 gap and the dirty HEP-R39 result. The dirty v2 projection artifact
  `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r39_dirty.json` has SHA-256
  `8a11d0962d31ddb52b28256c5469174cf57fce23888f553923af1c21ba6a30ba`,
  projection digest
  `6c19f2eef039b494f8fddc42b8e0941e464adc8fc93e5502f4eadfd04cbc9c3b`,
  and covariance-aware chi2/dof `68.41787311159007`. This is a narrowed
  model-gap diagnostic only: synthetic dirty freeze, no accepted comparison
  law, no empirical adequacy, and no W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.

## 2026-05-04

- add HEP-R38 dirty comparison diagnostic:
  `HEPDataT43DASHINativeComparisonDiagnostic.agda` records a covariance-aware
  diagnostic comparison of the dirty HEP-R37 artifact against t44. The current
  finite-trit `sigma_DASHI` construction has chi2 `6402144.431093033`, 18
  degrees of freedom, chi2/dof `355674.6906162796`, residual range
  `0.877355159718522` to `0.9086506463845561`, and first three pulls above
  `1500`. This is a model-gap signal only: dirty artifact, no accepted chi2
  receipt, no comparison law, no empirical adequacy, and no W3/W4/W5/W8
  promotion.
- add HEP-R37 dirty projection-run diagnostic:
  `HEPDataT43DASHINativeProjectionRunDiagnostic.agda` records the first
  `sigma_DASHI` t43/t44 diagnostic run. The artifact at
  `/tmp/t43_projection_hep_r37_dirty.json` has
  `projectionComplete = true`, 18 bins, file SHA-256
  `aeab81212b9f341f14d2e7147b4fd3dd64f4fa7d78a4c14beabd1518d853229c`, and
  projection digest
  `175c4872bd0db2cf108456c62e4c01295333af3c3aec186f07b4a2832cb4d8a6`.
  The freeze hash is synthetic (`HEP-R37-dirty-diagnostic`) and the worktree is
  dirty, so the run is non-promoting and supplies no accepted projection
  receipt, chi2, comparison law, empirical adequacy, or W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R36 `sigma_DASHI` construction surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/Prediction/sigma_dashi.py` now exposes a runner-callable
  `DASHI.Physics.Prediction.sigma_dashi:predict_ratio` hook backed by
  deterministic finite trit-state enumeration and a public
  `sigma_DASHI(m_lo, m_hi, phi_lo, phi_hi)` signature. The hook ignores
  observed t43 ratios, uncertainties, and t44 covariance.
  `HEPDataT43DASHINativeProjectionReceipt.agda` records the matching
  DashiDynamics/FascisticContraction-backed construction request, EW-depth
  mass-window binding, lambda policy, and non-promotion boundary. HEP-R36 is
  indexed and diagrammed, but clean freeze, projection artifact,
  comparison-law receipt, and W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion remain unconstructed.
- add SIB-MATRIX, HEP-R35, and LILA-R2 count-support surfaces:
  `SiblingMathPortingMatrix.agda` classifies sibling artifacts as
  port-to-Agda, citation-only, diagnostic-only, or ignore-for-closure, with
  dashifine contraction/Lyapunov/seam material as the first port candidates.
  `HEPDataT43DASHINativeAPIRouteDiagnostic.agda` records that sibling repos
  and the CSS/Sudakov hook do not supply an accepted `sigma_DASHI` t43
  phi-star ratio API, so DashiDynamics projection construction remains the
  HEP-R35 blocker. `LilaE8RootEnumerationReceiptR2.agda` records the bounded
  `112 + 128 = 240` E8 root-count support surface while preserving the missing
  duplicate-freedom, completeness, norm/inner-product, Weyl-closure, and
  projection-compatibility obligations. All three surfaces are indexed by
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex` and diagrammed as non-promoting.
- add SIB-R1 sibling evidence inventory:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SiblingEvidenceInventory.agda` records useful
  sibling-repo evidence pointers from `dashifine`, `dashiQ`, `dashitest`,
  `DASHIg`, and `dashi_lean4`, then indexes the inventory from
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex`. The surface is explicitly non-promoting: it
  creates no clean freeze, accepted DASHI prediction API, projection receipt,
  comparison law, E8 carrier receipt, Lam-Tung adapter, or W3/W4/W5/W6/W8/W9
  promotion token.
- add SIB-R2 sibling evidence extraction diagnostic:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SiblingEvidenceExtractionDiagnostic.agda` records
  bounded worker findings from the sibling scan. `dashifine` remains a
  coefficient-flow/proxy diagnostic rather than an accepted phi-star ratio API,
  the Lyapunov output is aggregate support only, the E8 morpheme files are a
  2048-entry tokenizer vocabulary rather than 240 roots, and the Lean files
  support moonshine arithmetic rather than theta/J closure.
- add LILA-R1a through LILA-R5 request surfaces:
  `LilaE8InitialisationPriorNote.agda` records SPUTNIKAI/sovereign-lila-e8 as
  related engineering provenance, rejects AllenAI/Lila as unrelated, and blocks
  LILA-E8 benchmark results from becoming DASHI evidence. `LilaE8RootEnumeration`,
  `LamTungE8AdapterSurface`, and `LilaE8ThetaJBridgeSurface` record R2/R3/R4
  obligations without proving them. `LilaE8PhiStarProjectionReceipt` records
  R5 as parked on accepted R2/R3/R4 receipts and explicitly rejects the
  CSS/Sudakov baseline as the accepted DASHI prediction API. No E8 theorem,
  Lam-Tung adapter, phi-star projection, comparison law, or W3/W4/W5/W8
  promotion is claimed.
- assign HEP-R34 and LILA-R1 parallel lanes:
  `HEPDataResidualBridgeWorkerQueue.agda` now records `Russell` as owner of a
  non-promoting CSS/Sudakov phi-star ratio baseline hook and `Mencius` as
  owner of the local LILA/E8 root-system lattice diagnostic. The HEPData child
  diagram now shows HEP-R34 and LILA-R1 as coordination surfaces only. The
  baseline hook may exercise the runner, but it is not an accepted DASHI
  prediction API, comparison-law receipt, empirical adequacy receipt, or
  W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R33 phi-star ratio prediction API route diagnostic:
  `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` now actually consumes a supplied
  `--prediction-api module:function` hook, validates that it returns one finite
  ratio per t43 bin, and emits a `projectionComplete = true` projection
  artifact only when that hook succeeds. By default it still exits fail-closed
  with `projectionComplete = false`. `HEPDataT43PredictionAPIRouteDiagnostic.agda`
  records the remaining missing receipt as the accepted DASHI phi-star ratio
  API for `sigma_DASHI(50-76, bin) / sigma_DASHI(76-106, bin)`, not generic
  physics/projection surfaces. No chi2, comparison law, empirical adequacy, or
  W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion is claimed.
- add HEP-R32 fail-closed t43 projection-runner implementation attempt:
  `HEPDataT43ProjectionRunnerImplementationAttempt.agda` records the concrete
  script lane for `scripts/run_t43_projection.py` and
  `scripts/assert_clean_worktree.sh`, binding it to the verified HEP-R28
  t43/t44 digests and explicitly marking `projectionComplete = false` until a
  real DASHI phi-star ratio prediction function and accepted clean
  `predictionFixedAt` receipt exist. This is executable infrastructure only;
  it does not construct chi2, a comparison law, empirical adequacy, or
  W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion.
- add HEP-R28 checksum-bound t43/t44 artifact receipt:
  `HEPDataRatioTableArtifactReceipt.agda` records the successful name-based
  HEPData CSV acquisition route for `t43` and `t44`, binds local artifact
  paths and SHA-256 digests, and rejects the short `/t43`, `/t44`, and
  `Table 43` endpoint forms because they returned HEPData error HTML. This
  solves the local artifact checksum prerequisite only; it does not parse the
  CSVs, freeze a prediction, run projection, construct a comparison law, or
  promote W3/W4/W5/W8.
- add HEP-R31 future comparison-law receipt skeleton:
  `HEPDataComparisonLawReceiptRequest.agda` records the requested future
  t43/t44 comparison receipt fields: adapter receipt, projection artifact,
  t43/t44 digests, freeze hash, worktree-clean certificate, chi2, chi2/dof,
  per-bin two-sigma law, and authority DOI. The receipt shape is intentionally
  uninhabited in this lane and does not claim a chi2 result, accepted
  comparison law, empirical adequacy, or W3 promotion.
- add HEP-R30 clean prediction-freeze policy request:
  `HEPDataPredictionFreezePolicyRequest.agda` records the exact supplied
  sequence (`clean via stash/commit`, `rev-parse HEAD`, runner uses that hash)
  plus the worktree-clean certificate shape. It explicitly keeps
  `e137415fe60aa470b9cd41d2357d9494592c0cec` diagnostic-only while the
  worktree is dirty and does not claim an accepted `predictionFixedAt`,
  projection run, artifact digest, or promotion.
- add HEP-R20 through HEP-R23 follow-up receipt surfaces:
  `HEPDataCMSSMP20003ExternalSourceAuthorityReceipt.agda` now treats
  `10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-11631-7` as the canonical CMS-SMP-20-003 paper DOI
  and rejects `10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-11680-y` as the wrong pointer;
  `HEPDataRatioAdapterTransformReceiptRequest.agda` selects the dimensionless
  `t43/t44` ratio route for `50-76 / 76-106`; and
  `HEPDataPredictionFreezeProjectionRunRequest.agda` records the remaining
  internal `predictionFixedAt` plus DASHI projection-run obligation. The W5/W6
  inventory was expanded to the full consumer-relevant table map while keeping
  all lanes non-promoting.
- add HEP-R24 through HEP-R27 follow-up diagnostics:
  `HEPDataRatioTableArtifactRequest.agda` records the `t43/t44` ratio
  artifact request, now superseded by the HEP-R28 checksum-bound artifacts;
  `HEPDataDASHIProjectionRunnerDiscovery.agda` records that no exact
  digest-bound DASHI t43 projection runner exists; `HEPDataPredictionFreezeIdentityDiagnostic.agda`
  records the current HEAD as diagnostic-only because the dirty worktree blocks
  accepted `predictionFixedAt`; and
  `HEPDataRatioComparisonLawIntakeRequest.agda` records the comparison-law
  intake prerequisites. No empirical adequacy, projection receipt, comparison
  law, or W3 promotion is claimed.
- add HEP-R16 through HEP-R19 follow-up receipt surfaces:
  `HEPDataCMSSMP20003ExternalSourceAuthorityReceipt.agda` records the
  CMS-SMP-20-003 source-authority pointers for `ins2079374`, t19/t20, and
  response matrices t68/t69; this entry was superseded later in the same round
  by HEP-R20, which resolves `11631-7` as canonical and rejects `11680-y`;
  `HEPDataAdapterTransformReceiptRequestDiagnostic.agda` isolates the raw
  t19/t20 versus normalized local artifact adapter-transform gap;
  `W4CalibrationRatioZPeakReceiptRequestSurface.agda` names the same-record
  Z-peak, ratio, covariance, and response anchors; and
  `W5W6PhysicsConsumerSourceInventory.agda` inventories high-mass W5 tables and
  W6 theory-adapter candidates with CASCADE TMD first. These are indexed as
  non-promoting request/diagnostic surfaces only; W3, W4, W5, W6, and W8
  remain blocked.
- add the HEPData empirical authority collation/correction packet:
  `HEPDataEmpiricalAuthorityReceiptCollation.agda` records CMS-SMP-20-003
  source metadata, fetched raw HEPData table artifacts, and the
  CMS-SMP-19-010 calibration baseline as a non-promoting receipt collation.
  It corrects the phistar binding to HEPData publication record `ins2079374`,
  `phistar mass 50-76` table DOI `10.17182/hepdata.115656.v1/t19`, and
  covariance table `t20`; the earlier `t31` pointer is rejected for this lane
  because it names a different pT-ratio table. Raw upstream values
  (`228.59 -> 225.69`) and normalized local artifact values
  (`188.4 -> 185.09`) are now explicitly separated, leaving an
  adapter-transform receipt, projection law, comparison law, accepted
  authority route, and W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion open.
- make diagram rendering deterministic:
  `scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh` now renders each PlantUML file separately
  for SVG and PNG, avoiding the batch Graphviz failure seen when all docs
  diagrams are passed through one PlantUML process.
- split the oversized worker coordination diagram:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml` is now a compact current-state map, and
  `Docs/HEPDataResidualCoordinationMap.puml` carries the HEP-R1..R33 child
  graph. This preserves the diagram as a renderable coordination surface while
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` remains the full lane-history source.
- wire roadmap gate G4 to W5:
  `Docs/CompleteVerifiedPhysicsUnificationRoadmap.md`,
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`, `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`, and
  `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now explicitly track `W5` / `Maxwell` as
  the owner of the `W-GR` GR-curvature / GR-QFT completion workstream. This is
  coordination wiring only; no GR/QFT theorem completion, field equation law,
  interaction law, empirical validation, or W5 promotion is claimed.
- add the roadmap to the future target claim:
  `Docs/CompleteVerifiedPhysicsUnificationRoadmap.md` defines the gated path
  from the current maturity state to a publishable "complete and verified
  physics unification" claim. The roadmap adds G1-G7 gates for canonical spine
  stability, Maxwell/gauge completion, Schrödinger completion, GR curvature /
  GR-QFT completion, empirical validation, cross-lane consistency, and
  publication audit without promoting the current repo state.
- add the physics lane maturity matrix:
  `Docs/PhysicsLaneMaturityMatrix.md` records Maxwell/gauge, Schrödinger,
  GR-curvature, and prediction lanes as present/bridged/packaged but not
  theorem-complete or empirically validated; the physics roadmap diagrams now
  surface the same status without promoting any lane
- add the HEPData residual observable-class external alignment:
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassExternalAlignment.agda` maps the internal
  `fluctuationProfile` candidate to the externally legible class
  "adjacent-bin finite-difference residual / local bin-to-bin variation" and
  records the minimal publishable non-collapse statement while preserving the
  missing authority, calibration/covariance, projection, comparison-law, and
  W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion boundaries
- add the HEPData residual observable-class proto-receipt:
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassProtoReceipt.agda` packages the
  `phistar_50_76` residual class candidate as an externalizable
  `residualObservableClassReceipt` payload while proving local intake remains
  rejected at first-missing residual class and the authority gate remains
  blocked; no W3/W4/W5/W8 promotion is constructed
- add the HEPData residual observable-class candidate diagnostic:
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassCandidateDiagnostic.agda` specializes the
  residual observable-class request to the local `phistar_50_76` evidence
  pointer as a `fluctuationProfile` under the adjacent-bin local-invariance
  baseline, but still does not construct `residualObservableClassReceipt` or
  promote W3/W4/W5/W8
- add the HEPData external residual witness payload and first local candidate
  diagnostic: `HEPDataExternalResidualWitnessPayload.agda` binds the
  `nonCollapseWitnessReceipt` payload field to the provider/intake/gate
  surfaces without constructing the external receipt, and
  `HEPDataExternalResidualWitnessCandidateDiagnostic.agda` records the
  `phistar_50_76` local evidence pointer, checksums, bin pair, candidate
  residual delta, and first-missing `residualObservableClassReceipt`
- extend the HEPData residual bridge into the explicit receipt-filter core:
  `HEPDataEmpiricalResidualBridgeCore.agda` records the generic residual
  observable, baseline/invariance, non-collapse witness, defect projection, and
  residual-to-defect comparison-soundness shape; `HEPDataResidualProviderPayloadIntake.agda`
  records provider payload fields and canonical first-missing intake outcomes;
  and `HEPDataResidualBridgeAuthorityGate.agda` accepts only a full residual
  receipt chain or first-missing typed diagnostic while rejecting raw/path /
  unchecksumed/no-route/no-witness provider answers. These remain
  non-promoting and are indexed from the P0 provider/blocker surfaces.
- add the HEPData residual/deviation retarget round:
  `HEPDataResidualBridgeWorkerQueue.agda` records HEP-R1..R3 assignments,
  `HEPDataResidualObservableClassRequest.agda` requires residual/deviation /
  anomaly / symmetry-breaking / defect-profile observable classes instead of
  raw saturated values, `HEPDataDefectProjectionDiagnostic.agda` retargets the
  theorem-side bridge to DASHI defect/residual profiles and blocks raw/constant
  projections, and `HEPDataResidualSourceCandidateDiagnostic.agda` inventories
  local residual-like HEPData artifacts without treating them as accepted
  receipts
- extend the HEPData residual retarget into provider-ready receipt surfaces:
  `HEPDataResidualProviderReceiptRequestPack.agda` consolidates HEP-R1/R2/R3
  under a first-missing residual receipt policy,
  `HEPDataNonCollapseObservableObligation.agda` names the external witness
  required to prove a selected residual observable is non-collapsing, and
  `HEPDataResidualComparisonLawRequest.agda` narrows comparison to residual
  modes such as sign pattern, normalized pull, covariance-whitened distance,
  defect-class match, or anomaly ranking
- extend `HEPDataProviderReceiptRequestPack.agda` and
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` so residual/deviation observable-class and
  DASHI defect-projection receipts are first-class non-promoting HEPData bridge
  requirements; W3, W4, W5, and W8 remain externally blocked
- add `HEPDataEmpiricalSourceCandidateDiagnostic.agda` and index it from
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda`, recording that local HEPData /
  `MeasurementSurface` source candidates exist while the accepted empirical
  bridge still lacks `HEPDataObservable` schema/checksum, physical-observable
  / table-column selection, units, calibration, comparison law,
  `MeasurementSurface -> DashiState` projection, metric propagation,
  HEPData-to-ITIR authority adapter, W3 accepted authority, and W8
  origin-promotion receipts
- update `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`, `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`,
  `README.md`, `TODO.md`, `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` so the next empirical workers target a concrete
  `DASHI observable -> HEPData observable` bridge or typed projection
  rejection, rather than another raw data-source search
- add the next HEPData bridge round:
  `HEPDataBridgeWorkerQueue.agda` assigns HEP-A through HEP-F,
  `HEPDataObservableSchema.agda` defines the schema/checksum request surface,
  `HEPDataObservableSelectionDiagnostic.agda` records the blocked observable /
  table-column selection gate, `HEPDataUnitCalibrationRequirementDiagnostic.agda`
  records the unit/dimension/calibration receipt requirements,
  `HEPDataMeasurementSurfaceProjectionRejection.agda` records the current
  `MeasurementSurface -> DashiState` boundary as a typed rejection, and
  `HEPDataComparisonAuthorityRouteDiagnostic.agda` records the comparison-law
  and accepted dataset authority route as blocked future receipt shapes before
  `HEPDataITIRAuthorityAdapterDiagnostic.agda` records that generic ITIR
  provenance scaffolding exists but no HEPData-specific authority adapter/token
  is present; all four are indexed as non-promoting coordination/diagnostic
  surfaces
- add `HEPDataProviderReceiptRequestPack.agda` as the consolidated HEPData
  provider-facing receipt pack and index it from the P0 provider/blocker
  surfaces. The pack co-locates the observable schema, selection receipt,
  unit-calibration receipt, theorem-side projection receipt, ITIR
  authority-adapter receipt, comparison-law receipt, accepted dataset authority
  token, and accepted route, while constructing none of them.
- record the active W1-W4 theorem/bridge assignment round in
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`, `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`,
  `README.md`, and `TODO.md`: `W1`=`Erdos`, `W2`=`Boole`, `W3`=`Tesla`,
  `W4`=`Poincare`
- integrate the W1-W4 worker results:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCurrentCarrierObstruction.agda` sharpens W1 by
  proving the current carriers do not close both MDL alignment legs;
  `CanonicalDynamicsLawTheorem.agda` now carries a finite shift-flow
  `P0.ConvergenceBound`; `EmpiricalAdequacyCarrierDiagnostic.agda` records the
  narrow packaged empirical equality plus full-profile mismatch; and
  `ChemistryRightLimitsQuotientCrossBandCouplingRequirement.agda` now carries
  a symmetric, quotient-sensitive, diagonal-nontrivial Candidate256 law surface
- refine the W4 symmetry statement:
  `ChemistryRightLimitsQuotientCrossBandCouplingRequirement.agda` now defines
  a simultaneous sheet-sign reversal involution and proves the cross-band
  coupling kernel is invariant under that reversal, making the W4 symmetry
  gate native to the structural trit/lattice representation rather than an
  external temporal/provenance predicate
- keep the dependency rule explicit: `W1` is the carrier-critical blocker for
  full `W3` empirical equality and `W4` carrier promotion, while `W2` remains
  partially independent but affects convergence checkability
- preserve the governance boundary: the assignment round is coordination only
  and does not discharge any red/yellow blocker without targeted Agda or a
  typed mismatch diagnostic
- start a bounded follow-up round: `W1b` stays with `Erdos` for a
  replacement/retargeted MDL channel or typed next-ingredient diagnostic, and
  `W2b` stays with `Boole` for a realization-independent metric/horizon
  convergence target; `W3` and `W4` are parked until carrier/channel inputs
  change
- integrate that follow-up round:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetedChannel.agda` now names the
  transported schedule MDL readout as a retargeted noncanonical channel, and
  `CanonicalDynamicsLawTheorem.agda` now carries a local
  `PointedMetricHorizonConvergenceTarget`; both remain guarded against full
  promotion until the retargeted-channel policy/theorem and realization-family
  metric coherence exist
- integrate the dependency-reduction round:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetedChannel.agda` now exposes
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyAssumption` and
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyAccepted`, while
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlNextIngredientGap.agda` names the required
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyIngredient`; this makes the W1
  retarget-policy gate typed without asserting that the old current carrier is
  CR-flat or that repo policy has already accepted the retargeted target
- extend `CanonicalDynamicsLawTheorem.agda` with
  `RealizationIndexedPointedMetricConvergenceTarget` and
  `canonicalShiftRealizationMetricConvergenceFamily`, giving W2 a nontrivial
  realization-tagged shift-flow metric/horizon/rate witness while keeping the
  wider natural/`p2` theorem boundary explicit
- add a conservative W8 origin-observation receipt surface:
  `P0BlockadeProofObligations.agda` now defines `EmpiricalReceiptStatus` and
  `OriginObservationReceipt`, and `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` records
  that this names carrier transport, origin observation map, signature owner,
  dynamics witness, empirical status/caution, and CRT/J bridge without
  promoting empirical adequacy, convergence, or seam closure
- formalize the W3 meaning of `mismatch diagnostic`:
  `P0BlockadeProofObligations.agda` now defines trits, trit-level mismatch
  kinds, the five F-component causes, and `MismatchDiagnostic`; W3 now records
  structured diagnostics for the chi2 pool, chi2 tail lift, B4 standalone
  status, full-profile universe mismatch, and missing origin observation map.
  Reader docs now state that a bare inequality is not an admissible diagnostic.
- assign the targeted dependency round:
  `Bernoulli` owns `W8b` for an origin-observation receipt instance or typed
  missing-field diagnostic, and `Hubble` owns `W3b` for the B4 empirical
  dependency clarification. `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md`,
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`, `README.md`, and `TODO.md` now record
  that the `W1` retarget-policy ingredient remains governance-parked rather
  than worker-inhabited.
- integrate the targeted dependency round:
  `MinimalCredibleShiftOriginObservation.agda` now instantiates a concrete
  non-promoting `OriginObservationReceipt` for `minimumCredibleClosureShift`,
  marks it `empiricalBlocked`, and exposes
  `missingEmpiricalAdequacyBridge`; `EmpiricalAdequacyCarrierDiagnostic.agda`
  now carries `B4EmpiricalDependencyReceipt`, making the B4 closure/observable
  promotion bridge separate from the empirical B4 shell-validation blocker.
- add the W1d retarget-policy decision:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlRetargetPolicyDecision.agda` accepts exactly the
  canonical retargeted schedule-MDL channel by equality, inhabits
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyIngredient`, and produces
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlCRRetargetPolicyAccepted` without asserting that
  the old current noncanonical carrier is CR-flat.
- integrate the W3c/W4c policy-consumption results:
  `EmpiricalAdequacyCarrierDiagnostic.agda` now consumes the W1d policy decision
  and W8b origin receipt while keeping the origin side `empiricalBlocked`, and
  `ChemistryPhysicalHandoffDiagnostic.agda` records the accepted-carrier
  Candidate256 quotient/cross-band pre-handoff with status
  `missingPhysicalConsumer`.
- start the remainder-narrowing round:
  `Carson` owns `W3d` for chi2 fixed-point carrier transport or a sharper typed
  obstruction, and `Ptolemy` owns `W4d` for a physical-consumer surface or
  sharper missing-ingredient diagnostic.
- integrate the remainder-narrowing results:
  `Chi2FixedPointCarrierTransportObstruction.agda` names the positive
  `Chi2FixedPointCarrierTransportReceipt` and records the current
  `blockedByPoolMismatchAndNoSameSurface` obstruction, while
  `ChemistryPhysicalHandoffDiagnostic.agda` now sharpens W4's missing consumer
  to `missingRetargetedQuotientInterpretationCarrierOrPreservationLaw`.
- start the dual-discharge attempt round:
  `Carver` owns `W3e` for the chi2 same-surface / fixed-point
  defect-observation receipt, and `Darwin` owns `W4e` for the retargeted
  quotient physical interpretation carrier/preservation law.
- integrate the dual-discharge results:
  `Chi2FixedPointCarrierTransportObstruction.agda` now inhabits the chi2
  transport receipt but records it as `carrierForgettingConstantReceiptOnly`,
  and `ChemistryPhysicalHandoffDiagnostic.agda` now inhabits a boundary-only
  `canonicalRetargetedQuotientChemistryPhysicalConsumer` with status
  `retargetedQuotientPrePhysicalConsumerAvailable`.
- integrate the blocker-tightening results:
  `Chi2NonForgettingSameSurfaceObstruction.agda` records that the current
  same-`Nat` defect target cannot also distinguish primary/secondary chi2
  cases, and `ChemistryStrictPhysicalSemanticsBlocker.agda` records the strict
  physical semantics gap as missing scale-setting, spectral observable,
  bonding, and empirical physical validation ingredients.
- integrate the obligation-surfacing results:
  `Chi2CanonicalPoolObservationCandidate.agda` adds a local nonconstant chi2
  pool discriminator that remains non-empirical and non-promoting, and
  `W4StrictPhysicalNextObligation.agda` packages the strict Candidate256
  physical handoff fields as obligations-needed rather than inhabited theorem
  claims.
- integrate the local-transport/ledger results:
  `Chi2ToShiftPressureTransportCandidate.agda` maps the local chi2 pool onto
  the start/next/held shift-pressure carrier with pairwise distinction while
  refusing fixed-point empirical adequacy, and
  `W4StrictPhysicalObligationLedger.agda` orders the strict Candidate256
  physical lanes with scale-setting first.
- add the W3 local-dynamics bridge:
  `Chi2TransportDynamicsToFixedPointBridge.agda` composes the local chi2
  transport with the existing two-step shift absorption theorem, leaving only
  empirical observation target and promotion bridge work for that local W3
  path.
- add the W3/W4 obligation-narrowing surfaces:
  `W3EmpiricalTargetPromotionBridgeObligation.agda` packages the remaining W3
  empirical target/promotion obligations, and
  `W4StrictPhysicalScaleSettingLaneObligation.agda` narrows the first strict
  physical Candidate256 lane to scale carrier, quotient-class scale map, and
  `L_chem` scale-preservation law requirements.
- add the W3/W4 surrogate-boundary surfaces:
  `W3SurrogateEmpiricalTargetBoundary.agda` inhabits the W3 target/promotion
  shape with a synthetic non-authoritative target, and
  `W4SurrogateScaleSettingBoundary.agda` inhabits the scale-setting shape with
  a dimensionless `Nat` diagonal while preserving the physical
  units/calibration blocker.
- add the W3/W4 authority and calibration gates:
  `W3AcceptedEmpiricalAuthorityGate.agda` records that current photonuclear
  evidence remains empirical-only while B4 and origin promotions are blocked,
  and `W4PhysicalCalibrationGate.agda` records that the dimensionless scale
  surrogate still needs physical units, calibration, and dimensional
  preservation before scale-setting promotion.
- harden those W3/W4 gates:
  `W3AcceptedEvidenceAuthorityToken` and
  `Candidate256PhysicalCalibrationAuthorityToken` are constructorless in the
  current repo, preventing the synthetic W3 target or dimensionless W4 `Nat`
  scale surrogate from accidentally promoting without a new upstream authority
  receipt.
- add external-intake obligation surfaces for the hardened gates:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceiptObligation.agda` names the external
  accepted-evidence authority receipt shape needed to combine authority,
  evidence-backed target, B4 empirical promotion, and origin promotion, while
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceiptObligation.agda` names the external
  physical-calibration receipt shape needed for units, calibration,
  factorization, and dimensional preservation. Both record current status as
  blocked/obligations-needed only.
- add next-obligation surfaces for the remaining open lanes:
  `GRQFTConsumerNextObligation.agda` records W5 downstream GR/QFT consumer
  fields with a constructorless promotion authority token,
  `DASHI/Interop/PNFResidualConsumerNextObligation.agda` records W6
  receipt-backed ITIR/PNF residual consumer requirements without labels by
  inspection, and `CancellationPressureCompatibilityNextObligation.agda`
  records W9's existing pressure-witness route plus the weighted-valuation
  replacement seam.
- add final-boundary obligation surfaces for the remaining coordination lanes:
  `CanonicalToNoncanonicalMdlRetargetFinalSeamObligation.agda` records W1's
  final retargeted-seam receipt and handoff requirements,
  `NaturalP2ConvergencePromotionObligation.agda` records W2's broader
  natural/p2 promotion requirements beyond the shift-flow convergence
  receipts, `ClaimGovernancePromotionObligation.agda` records W7 authority and
  validation requirements for guarded chart readings, and
  `OriginReceiptPromotionExternalObligation.agda` records W8's external
  promotion receipt requirements while keeping the current origin receipt
  `empiricalBlocked`.
- add a board-wide P0 obligation index:
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` imports the current W1-W9 obligation/status
  surfaces as a single targeted smoke-check module for worker coordination and
  discoverability. It is explicitly non-promoting and does not inhabit external
  authority, calibration, empirical, origin, GR/QFT, PNF, natural, or
  cancellation-pressure receipts.
- add route-narrowing queue surfaces:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityRouteNarrowing.agda` names the accepted-authority route
  and current constructorless-token blockers for W3,
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationRouteNarrowing.agda` narrows W4 to physical units,
  Nat-to-unit calibration, quotient-scale factorization, dimensional
  preservation, and validation, and `P0SecondaryObligationQueue.agda` co-locates
  W5/W6/W9 current obligation statuses. `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` now
  imports these route surfaces without promoting any lane.
- record the current coordination plateau:
  after the route-narrowing queue round, the next admissible work for W3, W4,
  W5, W6, W8, and W9 requires external authority, calibration, empirical,
  runtime, origin-promotion, or pressure-witness receipts rather than another
  local surrogate-promotion worker.
- add a unified energy-functional coordination surface:
  `UnifiedEnergyFunctionalSurface.agda` records the already-present Lyapunov
  skeleton across UFTC severity max-propagation, strict-contraction
  distance-to-fixed-point descent, finite shift quadratic energy, and
  `JFixedPoint` normalization to `196884`. `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda`
  imports the surface as a smoke target, but this does not merge carriers or
  promote external empirical, physical-calibration, runtime, origin, or
  pressure receipts.
- add a receipt-driven blocker-kill matrix:
  `BlockerKillConditions.agda` records W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, W6, W8, and W9 as
  typed kill conditions with receipt, authority/evidence wrappers, no-bypass
  laws, and an `unblocked` promotion target once the relevant receipt exists.
  `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda` imports the matrix, but no missing receipt
  or authority/calibration token is constructed.
- assign the receipt-kill parallel lanes:
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml` now
  route `Noether`, `Turing`, `Curie-W3`, `Faraday`, `Maxwell`, `Liskov`,
  `Hypatia`, and `Planck` to the W1/W2/W3/W4/W5/W6/W8/W9 kill-condition
  receipts respectively. The assignment is parallel and receipt-driven; no
  lane is promoted by assignment alone.
- integrate the receipt-kill parallel lane results:
  W1 landed the final retargeted seam receipt and pre-physical handoff
  compatibility, and `BlockerKillConditions.w1KillCondition` now marks that
  final-seam kill condition as `unblocked` without reviving the old carrier;
  W2/W3/W4/W5 sharpened
  constructorless-token or missing receipt-field diagnostics; W6 added a
  runtime-evidence constructor for `PNFResidualConsumerReceipt`; W8 discharged
  origin-map compatibility and closure-boundary preservation while keeping
  empirical status blocked; and W9 added a weighted cancellation-pressure
  candidate receipt, then proved the current uniform
  cancellation-to-weighted-quadratic identification impossible at `(1 , 1)`,
  leaving W9 blocked on the existing pressure-witness route or a different
  replacement seam.
- integrate the receipt-kill follow-up round:
  Hopper/W6 added the explicit runtime-intake request surface for supplied
  consumer profile/id, paired runtime `PNFEmissionReceipt`s, and Hecke
  candidate-pool receipt id; Emmy/W8 added an externally gated promoted-status
  receipt shape while preserving `empiricalBlocked`; and Dirichlet/W9 proved
  the existing pressure-witness route obstructed for canonical-15 at `(1 , 3)`,
  leaving W9 dependent on a narrowed theorem family or different
  pressure-compatible quadratic target.
- integrate the receipt-source and route-selection round:
  Ada/W6 added a runtime receipt-source diagnostic showing no concrete in-repo
  runtime values satisfy the intake request; Gauss/W8 added an origin authority
  source diagnostic eliminating self-promotion and naming the missing external
  authority or origin adequacy bridge; and Riemann/W9 recorded current route
  exhaustion plus the next pressure-compatible retarget boundary, explicitly
  without claiming canonical Qcore promotion.
- integrate the external bridge split round:
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeObservable.agda` adds the Option A
  `E_total -> simple observable` surface while keeping measured values and
  empirical authority external; `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeUnits.agda` adds the
  Option B unit/dimension-preserving calibration surface while keeping numeric
  calibration authority constructorless; and
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeToyFit.agda` adds the Option C finite toy-fit
  surface while preventing toy adequacy from promoting W3/W8 empirical
  authority. `P0BlockerObligationIndex.agda`, the worker board, and the worker
  map now index these as non-promoting bridge interfaces.
- integrate the intake and retarget round:
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeObservableIntake.agda` names the exact external
  measured-value / witness / authority-token / match-proof receipt needed for
  Option A; `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeUnitsIntake.agda` names the unit,
  dimension, calibration, monotonicity, authority, and validation receipt plus
  `intakeReceiptToBridge` for Option B; and
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeToyFitAuthorityBoundary.agda` keeps finite toy-fit
  adequacy non-authoritative while routing real dataset evidence through W3/W8
  receipts. `CancellationPressureCompatibilityNextObligation.agda` now carries
  `PressureCompatibleTargetWithQcoreBoundaryReceipt` and
  `canonicalPairPressureRetargetReceipt`, landing the selected W9 retarget route
  with an explicit non-Qcore boundary and no `CancellationPressureCompatibility`
  or admissible-quadratic promotion.
- integrate the source diagnostic and consumer-obligation round:
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeObservableSourceDiagnostic.agda` records all
  Option A external measured-observable intake fields as missing;
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeUnitsSourceDiagnostic.agda` records all Option B
  unit-calibration source inputs as missing; and
  `EmpiricalCalibrationBridgeToyFitRealDatasetRouteDiagnostic.agda` records the
  real-dataset route as blocked on W3 external authority, W3 positive route, and
  W8 origin promotion receipts. `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerObligation.agda`
  names the downstream consumer acceptance receipt required before
  `canonicalPairPressureRetargetReceipt` can route around
  `CancellationPressureCompatibility`, preserving non-Qcore and no-admissible-
  quadratic-promotion boundaries.
- integrate the external request / source handoff round:
  `EmpiricalCalibrationExternalReceiptRequestPack.agda` consolidates the
  A3/B3/C3 missing external receipt fields into a provider-facing request pack;
  `GRQFTConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` records that W5 has bounded known-limits
  bridge sources but lacks promotion authority, laws, witnesses, downstream
  fields, and empirical validation;
  `PNFResidualConsumerReceiptRequestPack.agda` co-locates W6 runtime payload
  fields without fabricating receipts or labels; and
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerSourceDiagnostic.agda` records that W9
  still lacks a retarget consumer interface and acceptance receipt. The P0
  index, worker board, and worker map now include these non-promoting handoff
  surfaces.
- integrate the provider request-pack round:
  `GRQFTClosurePromotionReceiptRequestPack.agda` packages the exact W5
  closure-promotion provider payload; `OriginReceiptPromotionExternalRequestPack.agda`
  packages the exact W8 origin-promotion external receipt payload; and
  `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerAcceptanceRequestPack.agda` packages the
  exact W9 retarget consumer interface and acceptance receipt artifacts. The
  P0 index, worker board, and worker map now include these as non-promoting
  provider-facing request packs.
- sharpen the W9 dim-15 pressure obstruction:
  `CancellationPressureCompatibilityNextObligation.agda` now exposes
  `canonical15WeightedReplacementCandidateReceipt` and
  `canonical15DeltaToQuadraticClosureObstruction`, packaging the canonical
  `(1 , 3)` pressure-witness failure, the `(1 , 1)` weighted uniform
  identification failure, and the selected pressure-compatible retarget's
  non-Qcore boundary. `CancellationPressureRetargetConsumerAcceptanceRequestPack.agda`
  threads that typed obstruction into the provider handoff without constructing
  a `W9KillReceipt`, admissible quadratic promotion, or
  `CancellationPressureCompatibility`.
- integrate the empirical / calibration request-pack round:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityExternalReceiptRequestPack.agda` packages the exact W3
  accepted-authority external receipt payload, and
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationExternalReceiptRequestPack.agda` packages the exact W4
  Candidate256 physical-calibration receipt payload. Both are indexed and
  diagrammed as provider-facing request packs only, with no empirical
  authority, B4/origin promotion, calibration authority, physical unit system,
  dimensional law, or physical validation constructed.
- add the provider request-pack index:
  `P0ProviderReceiptRequestIndex.agda` co-locates the A/B/C, W3, W4, W5, W6,
  W8, and W9 provider-facing request packs in one typed handoff surface. The P0
  blocker index imports it, but no provider receipt or promotion is constructed.
- integrate the provider attempt diagnostic round:
  `W3AcceptedAuthorityProviderAttempt.agda` records that current W3 sources
  cannot construct an accepted-authority external receipt;
  `W4PhysicalCalibrationProviderAttempt.agda` records that current W4 sources
  cannot construct a Candidate256 physical-calibration receipt; and
  `PNFResidualConsumerRuntimeProviderAttempt.agda` records that current W6
  sources expose constructors/builders but still lack the concrete runtime
  payload. The P0 blocker index imports all three diagnostics without
  promoting any provider lane.
- integrate the empirical compatibility provider-attempt round:
  `EmpiricalCompatibilityOptionAProviderAttempt.agda`,
  `EmpiricalCompatibilityOptionBProviderAttempt.agda`, and
  `EmpiricalCompatibilityOptionCProviderAttempt.agda` record diagnostic-only
  attempts for measured-observable, unit-calibration, and real-dataset
  authority routes. All three are indexed as non-promoting evidence that
  empirical compatibility remains uninhabited until external measurement,
  calibration, authority, validation, W3, and W8 receipts arrive.

## 2026-05-03

- add a worker coordination surface for active diagram blockers.
  `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `Docs/WorkerCoordinationMap.puml`
  now translate the main roadmap blocker boxes into lane IDs `W0` through `W9`
  with owner labels, primary file surfaces, success conditions, and validation
  rules. `README.md`, `TODO.md`, `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md`, the
  autonomous-execution docs, and the main diagrams now route parallel workers
  through the board and explicitly mark the old closure checklist as
  historical/provenance. This is docs-only coordination; no theorem or blocker
  was discharged.

## 2026-05-02

- add spacetime-sheaf / mereological-space proof obligations and guardrails.
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.TemporalSheafProofObligations` now also names the
  minimal Agda record surfaces for spacetime sections over `(Time, Space)`,
  mereological containment, spatial overlap, spacetime gluing,
  exclusive-coordinate uniqueness, Cauchy-style slice evolution, and
  `JFixedPoint` spacetime-transition obstruction. `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`,
  `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`, `README.md`, and
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now state that spacetime, 3+1,
  Cauchy-surface, spacetime-density-matrix, or singularity readings remain
  proof obligations until typed carriers, gluing laws, evolution preservation,
  and transition-obstruction witnesses exist.
- add temporal-sheaf / time-indexed state proof obligations and guardrails.
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.TemporalSheafProofObligations` now names the minimal
  Agda record surfaces for time-indexed sections, overlap compatibility,
  `MereViol` non-gluability, exclusive-property single-valued fibres,
  `JFixedPoint`/`+1` topology-transition obligations, and temporal section
  metrics. `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`,
  `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`, `README.md`,
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md`, and `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md` now
  state that temporal qualifiers are not promoted into sheaves, topology
  changes, or ultrametric section distances without typed carriers,
  gluing/restriction laws, transition witnesses, and validation.
- add neurochemical / body-brain-chemistry guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `README.md`, and `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now treat
  synaptic/electrical, volume-transmission, endocrine/hormonal, and epigenetic
  or cultural propagation readings as biomedical cross-scale fixtures only.
  Promotion of GABA, glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, oxytocin,
  cortisol, insulin, acetylcholine, allostatic load, receptor-context,
  body:brain:chemistry, or Base369-biological identity language now requires
  typed biological carriers, receptor/context models, biomarker measurement
  protocols, causal hypotheses, biomedical validation, and clinical
  non-authority flags.
- add market self-observation / trader-operator guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `README.md`, and `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now treat
  trader-as-node, market-as-RG-stack, operator-trading psychology,
  three-conjunct signal architecture, MDL market compression, and
  `JFixedPoint trade` language as hypothesis fixtures only. Promotion to a
  market signal requires typed trader-state receipts, market-data receipts,
  cross-scale maps, execution/risk/cost/compliance rules, period/regime-change
  definitions where claimed, and out-of-sample validation. The main roadmap
  diagrams now include this as a claim-governance boundary, not a theorem lane.
- add the minimal P0 blocker proof-obligation interface.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/P0BlockadeProofObligations.agda` now defines the
  small record surfaces for MDL seam, finite convergence bound, empirical
  adequacy, p2 bridge or admissible-candidate obstruction, chemistry law,
  explicit field seam, realization independence, and origin receipt. The module
  is imported by `DASHI/Everything.agda` and typechecks standalone. This is an
  obligation surface only; it does not discharge the concrete blocker lanes.
- refresh diagram claim-governance coverage for the latest comparative-formalism
  additions.
  `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`, `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml`, and
  `Docs/RepoMetasystem.puml` now expose the mathematical-atlas /
  higher-structure and cross-scale physics/biology/consciousness guardrails as
  explicit diagram nodes. The canonical proof spine remains unchanged because
  these are hypothesis-governance surfaces, not theorem-owner promotions.
- add cross-scale physics / biology / consciousness guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `README.md`, and
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now state that quantum, QFT/RG,
  thermodynamic, chemical, molecular-biology, epigenetic, neuroscience,
  affective, theological, and consciousness readings are scale-unification
  fixtures, not current theorem claims. They require typed carriers at each
  scale, explicit scale maps, observable-preservation laws, measurement
  protocols, empirical validation, and clinical non-authority flags before
  projector/unitary, RG relevance, Landauer erasure, phase transition,
  correlation length, DNA eigenclass, epigenetic Dreaming-layer,
  predictive-processing, polyvagal/Base369, IIT Phi, or `JFixedPoint` claims
  are emitted.
- add mathematical-atlas / higher-structure guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `README.md`, and
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now state that category-theory,
  Jain-topos, HoTT, ergodic, information-geometric, coinductive /
  non-well-founded, tropical, renormalization, and infinity-categorical
  readings are future chart languages, not current theorem claims. They require
  typed chart carriers, morphisms from receipted PNF/residual/operator
  surfaces, preservation laws, and validation before adjunction,
  subobject-classifier, path-identity, scan-order, Fisher/MDL, hyperset,
  tropical-limit, RG relevance, infinity-topos, terminal-object, Monster, or
  `JFixedPoint` claims are emitted.
- add affective-state / feelings-wheel guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, and `README.md` now state that emotion
  wheel, vedana/sankhara, mindfulness-labeling, affective-collapse, trauma,
  PTSD, healing, high-Mana, Dreaming-centre, and personal-DASHI fixtures
  require a named affective taxonomy, source or subject/session receipts,
  psychometric or clinical validation status, contemplative-source profiles
  where relevant, typed tone/naming/perspective/wrapper carriers, and explicit
  clinical non-authority flags before Base369, Whakapapa, DharmaSystem,
  Amalek-collapse, treatment, diagnosis, or `JFixedPoint` claims are emitted.
- add East Asian / Indigenous living-lattice guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, and `README.md` now state that Taoist,
  Confucian, Shinto, Indigenous American, Maori, Aboriginal Australian, and
  broader living-lattice fixtures require culturally governed public receipts,
  place/community provenance where applicable, restricted-knowledge flags,
  topology-changing carrier definitions, relation/flow/graph/bundle/derivation
  rules, typed morphisms, and validation before carrier-substrate,
  natural-flow, relation-matrix, immanent-node, fully connected,
  derivation-graph, timeless-bundle, songline/scan-order, metric,
  `JFixedPoint`, or empirical-proof claims are emitted.
- add non-Abrahamic / N-body comparative-lattice guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, and `README.md` now state that Hindu,
  Buddhist, Jain, and broader non-Abrahamic comparative fixtures require
  school-level source receipts, interpretive-profile metadata, carrier
  definitions, role-binding or process translations, perspective/action
  semantics where relevant, typed morphisms into or away from PNF, and
  validation before identity-map, permanent-distance, telos-free action,
  process-dissolution, perspective-indexed, `JFixedPoint`, or universal
  terminus claims are emitted.
- add conditional-trigger / latent fixed-point guardrails for classifier
  fixtures.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`,
  `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`, and
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md` now state that terminal-looking traces
  may be modelled as triggered responses only after emitted trigger receipts,
  modality/qualifier rules, a trigger connective, deactivation semantics,
  latent fixed-point witness, and convergence theorem exist.
- add aggressor / responsibility-label guardrails for classifier fixtures.
  The same docs now state that ordinary aggressor labels require a shared-fibre
  PNF taxonomy, while incommensurable-operator responsibility labels require a
  cross-fibre responsibility taxonomy, cost/threat/response receipts,
  third-party burden provenance where relevant, and external validation.
- add existential-fibre / multi-domain operator-completeness guardrails.
  The same docs now state that existential-domain fixtures are separate from
  economic and theological fibres, requiring physical-survival witness
  receipts, source provenance, temporal/wrapper/modality fields, a
  warrant-ordering rule if domains are ranked, and a typed multi-domain
  interaction operator before operator-completeness or triple-domain claims are
  emitted.
- add enemy-classification operator guardrails.
  The same docs now state that lineage-fixed versus behaviour-conditional
  classifier claims require textual/source-span receipts, interpretive-profile
  metadata, classifier-input taxonomy, inverse/deactivation semantics, and
  validation before they can be compared with operator-duality or contraction
  surfaces.
- add collapsed-quotient / no-typed-meet guardrails.
  The classifier docs now state that a collapsed one-element or coarser
  lattice is well-formed inside the residual formalism. Cross-carrier
  comparison yields `noTypedMeet` unless an explicit product lattice or
  lift/redifferentiation model is supplied; quotient maps and lost-distinction
  records are required before impassability or resolution claims are emitted.
- add protected-identity / conduct-axis and three-body lattice guardrails.
  The classifier docs now state that two-axis and three-component lattice
  fixtures require role-binding taxonomies, component meet/join laws,
  product-lattice maps, projection/quotient/lift maps, decision-operator
  routing, decoupling rules where claimed, source receipts, and validation
  before any named legal/theological/historical system is classified.
- add hostile-provenance / four-body theology guardrails.
  The classifier docs now state that Basilides/Gnostic/Sufi/heresiological or
  infographic fixtures require source-critical receipts, adversarial/indirect
  witness qualifiers, orientation maps, product-lattice definitions, operator
  witnesses, and validation before any direct-doctrine, CRT/JFixedPoint,
  operator-duality, or current-conflict algebra claim is emitted. The docs also
  correct the missing-`Ultrametric` phrasing: the module exists; the missing
  ingredient would be a domain-specific theological-lattice metric.
- add Base369-chain / algebraic-lift guardrails.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md`, `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md`,
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md`,
  `Docs/ITIRPNFResidualLogicBridge.md`, `Docs/CoreSpineBridge.md`, and
  `Docs/CoreSpineReviewerFormalisms.md` now distinguish the rigorous
  Tri/Hex/Nonary cyclic-carrier surface from proposed theological,
  actor-count, Theta, strategy-window, resolution-condition, or global
  attractor semantics, which require typed carrier maps, commutation/seam
  proofs, operator witnesses, and validation.

## 2026-05-01

- add the normalized claim-comparison engine surface.
  `Docs/ClaimComparisonEngine.md` now records the repo-accurate chain from
  runtime PNF emission through `PNFEmissionReceipt`, `receiptResidual`,
  residual join laws, UFTC/DASHI pressure, tetralemma/sixfold carrier bridges,
  and `Ontology.Hecke.PNFResidualBridge`. It explicitly separates runtime
  emission from compiled residual algebra, corrects the stale
  `Ultrametric.agda` blocker claim, and names the remaining promotion gates.
  It now also records already-formal formula spans and attribution-by-response
  interview exchanges as conditional trace fixtures: useful test surfaces, but
  valid only after parser/reducer/formula-reader receipts emit typed atoms.
  It also now records the operator-level sufficient-statistic pattern for
  formula fixtures: a formula-reader receipt may emit a local-expansion
  hypothesis such as `f (f x) > f x`, but that does not prove a market period,
  actor classification, or real-world `AntiFascistSystem` instance without a
  separate model witness for the carrier, operator, observable, and
  obligations.
  It now also records the domain-incommensurability deterrence fixture: a
  formula can fail as deterrence if the target decision domain has no emitted
  measure bridge to the formula's cost domain. This is documented as an open
  design gate, not as a compiled residual constructor or a hand-assigned label
  for any live corpus.
  `Docs/AttractorOrbitClassifier.md` now records the downstream
  attractor/orbit classifier design over receipted residual, wrapper, domain,
  formula, and Hecke features. It keeps market-risk use behind empirical
  validation and hidden-operator inference behind causal/provenance validation;
  no trading signal, price floor, or causal-source attribution is claimed.
  It now also records the state-operator / political-label boundary:
  per-domain operator traces may support composite hypotheses only after
  receipts and feature extraction exist, while live state political labels
  require a separate taxonomy, receipt corpus, scope rule, and validation
  standard. `FascisticSystem` remains a formal entropy-collapsing projection
  property, not a direct political classification.
  It now also records the relational pair-operator boundary: an interaction
  claim over `S_left x S_right` needs directed receipts, a product carrier,
  coupling/composition law, and a joint convergence/non-convergence theorem
  before component trace labels can imply a joint fixed point, no-fixed-point
  result, terminal dominance, or operator-level sufficient statistic.
  It now also records the bot/source join-domain boundary: market-risk and
  causal-source readings can share a receipted feature stream, but exactness
  requires a typed observation map, orbit-input bijectivity or canonical
  representative theorem, a minimal-operator relation, and empirical/causal
  validation. `CRTPeriod` remains recurrence, not an injective classifier
  horizon, and `JFixedPoint` is not a trading convergence or source-selection
  certificate.
  It now also records the global phase-space / bifurcation boundary:
  capitalism/socialism/theology/reactive-operator labels are design fixtures,
  not theorem claims, until a global state carrier, basin metric, perturbation
  threshold, typed epistemic interaction operator, and validation standard are
  supplied. `s-mono` remains monotone severity aggregation; it does not by
  itself prove global reactive Jacobian dynamics or basin exit.
- add the PNF wrapper case-study boundary.
  `DASHI.Interop.SensibLawResidualLattice` now has
  `performativeEvidence` as a wrapper state, records that it mismatches
  `directEvidence`, and projects it to `scopeExceeded6` in the six-level
  residual carrier. It also now names `PNFEmissionReceipt` and
  `receiptResidual`, so text-side residual comparison is explicitly driven by
  parser/reducer/source-span receipts rather than analyst-assigned labels.
  `Docs/PNFCaseStudiesWatergateIran.md` documents Watergate as a closed
  evidence-corpus pattern and the current Iran-war rhetoric example as a live
  corpus fixture, with external reporting treated only as source-span context.
  The note now explicitly rejects hand-assigned wrapper, qualifier, role,
  signature, or residual labels.
- add the Hecke PNF residual fibre adapter.
  `Ontology.Hecke.PNFResidualBridge` now maps coarse Hecke defect classes into
  the PNF residual chain (`stable -> partial`, `illegal -> contradiction`,
  `other -> noTypedMeet`), proves illegal defects remain contradiction /
  critical pressure under joins, records the canonical saturated histogram as
  `partial`, and exposes quotient projection equality as the
  `SameHeckeCandidatePool` fibre over `QuotientInterfaceOn`.
- add ITIR PNF / residual logic carrier bridges.
  `DASHI.Interop.SensibLawResidualLattice` now formalizes the four residual
  levels as a join-semilattice, maps residual joins into DASHI pressure, and
  defines a signature-fibred `PredicatePNF` carrier shape without parser
  semantics. It also records wrapper gating, predicate-index fallback,
  `SixResidualLevel`, `hexToSixResidual`, non-wrap severity transport, the
  hex wrap seam, and six-level join/pressure preservation.
  `DASHI.Algebra.TetralemmaBridge` aligns `LogicTlurey.Stage` and residual
  levels through a four-position carrier, embeds `TriTruth` into
  `exact`/`partial`/`noTypedMeet` while excluding `contradiction` from the tone
  image, and `DASHI.Algebra.SixfoldLogic` maps a six-position carrier onto
  `Base369.HexTruth`. `DASHI.Everything` imports the bridge modules.
- add and aggregate-import the NGram / ITIR sidecar surfaces.
  `DASHI.Combinatorics.NGram` now names fixed-width ternary windows plus
  bigram/trigram aliases and adjacent agreement observables.
  `DASHI.Interop.ITIRJoinBridge` now maps UFTC severity/code joins into
  `DASHI.Pressure`, proves join preservation, and keeps monotonicity as named
  proof-gap types. `DASHI.Everything` imports both.
- fix an aggregate import blocker in `LilaTraceFamily`.
  The module now imports `ExecutionContractLaws` qualified-only, avoiding an
  overloaded `receipt` projection and allowing `DASHI.Everything` to typecheck.
- correct docs/UML current-state sidecar wording.
  `README.md`, `CoreSpineBridge.md`, `OriginTraceabilityLedger.md`,
  `RepoMetasystem.puml`, `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`, and
  `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now distinguish landed/imported CoreSpine and
  ultrametric bridge state from active next wiring. The diagrams no longer
  describe Brain dynamic transport, Brain-DNA whole-chain integration, the
  physics-facing brain handoff, or the p2 offline L2 obstruction certificate as
  still absent. They also record that `NGram` and `ITIRJoinBridge` exist as
  non-claiming adapter sidecars and are now aggregate-imported by
  `DASHI.Everything`.
- add the origin-traceability reconciliation surface.
  `Docs/OriginTraceabilityLedger.md` now records the safe reading of the
  downloaded disconnection diagnosis: the origin thesis is a bridge/governance
  spine, `AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem` exists locally but remains bounded,
  the empirical lane exists but lacks an adequacy theorem, and
  `CanonicalDynamicsLawTheorem` still needs a convergence-rate promotion.
  `README.md`, `architecture.md`, `PhysicsGuide`, `UnificationClaim`,
  `PhysicsRecoveryLedger`, `NaturalDynamicsLaw`, and `RepoMetasystem.puml` now
  route to that ledger.
- make the main diagrams more communicative about true repo state.
  `RepoMetasystem.puml`, `CanonicalProofSpine.puml`,
  `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`, and `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now include
  status boards that separate theorem-owned, bridge-only, packaging,
  empirical, and open-gate surfaces, including explicit notes for chi2 carrier
  mismatch, B4 `standaloneOnly`, convergence-rate dynamics, empirical
  adequacy, and atom/chemistry relaxation gates.
- render documentation diagrams to SVG and PNG.
  `scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh` now emits both formats for top-level
  `Docs/*.puml` files, and the generated PNG previews are present beside the
  existing SVG previews.
- add antifascistic boundary and music governance.
  `Docs/AntifascisticBoundaryAndMusic.md` now records the safe reading of
  invertible entropy-preserving systems, the three-body carrier-vs-observable
  split, and the music MDL basin toy.
  `Docs/MusicalSymmetryMDL.md` now records the safe pitch-class bridge
  `Z/12Z ~= Z/3Z x Z/4Z` and rejects the false perfect-fifth `Z3` shortcut.
  `RepoMetasystem.puml` and `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml` now show this lane as
  exploratory examples/toys rather than theorem closure.
- add the named musical attractor target.
  `Docs/MusicalAttractorTheorem.md` records the precise exploratory bridge:
  `(Z/12Z)^n` carrier, chromatic sum metric, nearest-scale `K_music`,
  `L_music` Lyapunov/MDL analog, one-step descent to `S^n`, attractor classes,
  CRT and tonal-cluster quotient separation, and explicit non-claim boundaries.
  `RepoMetasystem.puml`, `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml`, and
  `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml` now expose the target as an exploratory music
  surface rather than a theorem-owned physics lane.
- record the core-spine bridge-module request.
  The next implementation adds explicit `Trit`/`TriTruth`,
  CRT/J moonshine, ternary carrier, agreement-ultrametric contraction,
  stage-quotient, and p47/p59/p71 active-wall bridge modules, while preserving
  the distinction between proved bridges and still-open descent obligations.
- land the six core-spine bridge modules and import them from
  `DASHI.Everything`.
  The new surfaces prove the `Trit`/`TriTruth` isomorphism, scalar moonshine
  bridge, carrier-vector lift, `Stage` quotient seam, p47/p59/p71 active-wall
  positions, and the agreement-ultrametric strict-contraction-to-certificate
  path without claiming an abstract fascistic descent proof.
  Targeted Agda checks pass for the six new modules; the aggregate
  `DASHI.Everything` check remains longer than the 60s bounded validation
  window and timed out in existing closure imports.
- update docs and diagrams for the core-spine bridge.
  Added `Docs/CoreSpineBridge.md`, updated the physics guide, algebraic carrier
  summary, moonshine proof checklist, and validation-target list, then added a
  distinct CoreSpine bridge layer to `PhysicsUnificationMap.puml` and
  `PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml`.
  SVG previews were regenerated with `scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh`.
- tighten the reviewer-facing core-spine formalisms.
  `TritTriTruthBridge` now includes transported `tritXor`
  identity/associativity and an explicit non-homomorphism witness for
  `Trit.inv`; `TritCarrierBridge` now proves cyclic rotation isometry for the
  prefix ultrametric and exposes reflection isometry; `CRTPeriodJFixedBridge`
  now defines `W3` and names the still-open active-wall periodicity and
  Monster-representation obligations.
  Added `Docs/CoreSpineReviewerFormalisms.md` to separate supported theorem
  claims from the invalid stage-kernel/exact-sequence language and the unproved
  `W3` periodicity claim.
- record the algebra/logic/modular/contraction theorem-island bridge lane.
  The implementation target is explicit bridge or obstruction surfaces for
  `Base369`, `LogicTlurey`, `CRTPeriod`, `JFixedPoint`,
  `FascisticSystem`, and `Contraction`; the repo already has
  `Ultrametric.agda`, so the remaining gap is integration, not a missing file.
- land those bridge surfaces:
  `TriTruthScanOrderBridge` exposes the two-state `ScanOrder` equivariance
  obstruction and a refined three-state carrier,
  `LogicTlureyQuotientBridge` makes the seed/overflow quotient collapse
  explicit,
  `CRTJFixedPointBridge` connects `period + 1` to the moonshine contraction,
  and `FascisticContractionBridge` derives attractors only from explicit
  stabilization or strict-contraction witnesses while recording the remaining
  descent gap.
  `DASHI.Everything` now imports the bridge modules.
- record the theorem-island correction for the Brain/DNA/Chemistry lane.
  The next pass targets derived recovery boundaries, non-trivial checksum
  algebra, semantic equivariance, cross-band Hamiltonian distinction,
  brain/computer crossover, and a bounded antifascist/logic bridge rather than
  more theorem-thin wrapper records.
- add the first break-open surfaces for those theorem islands:
  a derived base-code recovery boundary plus default-code obstruction,
  non-trivial checksum algebra, Brain-DNA semantic equivariance, a sheet
  Hamiltonian distinguishing witness, a first brain/computer crossover, and a
  bounded LogicTlurey / antifascist bridge into the computer carrier.
- record the blocker-formula worker routing for the MDL/continuum,
  natural-charge/`p2`, and atomic-chemistry lanes.
  The abstract/canonical seam and GR/QFT consumer upgrade are explicitly
  dependency-parked until the MDL seam witness and adapter seam discharge land.
- record the Brain/DNA/Chemistry crossover routing.
  Brain dynamic transport and Brain-DNA whole-chain integration/realism are
  the next independent lanes; chemistry cross-band invariant work remains on
  the existing chemistry worker; the physics-facing brain-to-chemistry handoff
  is parked until the whole-chain integration law promotes.
- land the P1/P2 blocker-discharge surfaces through workers:
  the MDL/continuum lane now rejects the old global obligation and exposes the
  CR-retarget correction surface, while the natural-charge/`p2` lane now has a
  theorem-thin offline L2 obstruction certificate instead of a constructive
  `β_p2` bridge.
- land the first Brain/DNA/Chemistry crossover promotion surfaces through
  workers:
  brain dynamic semantic transport, Brain-DNA whole-chain integration with
  checksum compositionality and a realism floor, and the local chemistry
  cross-band invariant law.
  The physics-facing handoff is now the remaining bounded composition target.
- promote the brain-to-chemistry physics handoff as a bounded wrapper:
  `BrainPhysicsHandoffPromotion` composes `H_phys` through `I_chain`, carries
  the Candidate256 `Lchem` cross-band law, and exposes the existing
  `AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem` gate surfaces without widening to spectra,
  scale-setting, bonding, wet-lab realism, or full atom recovery.

## 2026-04-17

- inhabit the observable/signature pressure gate for the current physics
  closure round.  Added a canonical `promotionReady` instance, finite
  arithmetic distortion budget, alternative-carrier control cases, minimal
  observable gauge-entry fiber/action laws, and a receipt bridge carrying
  distortion plus observable/signature/promotion statuses.  Also added the
  PlantUML sketch in `Docs/ObservableSignatureGaugeEntryRound.puml`.
- extend the arithmetic distortion budget with
  `pairWeightedTransportedDistortion`, the first nontrivial computable
  DeltaPair comparison between scalar cancellation pressure and weighted pair
  energy.  The bound uses an exact finite epsilon and avoids asserting
  Delta/Q equality.
- strengthen `pairWeightedTransportedDistortion` so its public epsilon is now
  the structural `weightedSupport + scalarPressure` budget, proved via
  `weightedPressure≤weightedSupport`; the exact absolute difference remains
  available as `pairExactEpsilon`.
- tighten `pairWeightedTransportedDistortion` again by replacing the scalar
  self-budget with tracked support.  The public epsilon is now
  `weightedSupport + trackedSupport`, using
  `weightedPressure≤weightedSupport` for the weighted side and
  `totalPressure≤trackedSupport` for the scalar side.
- thread that decomposed pair support budget into the observable/signature
  receipt lane.  `PairSupportDistortionBudget` now exposes the weighted leg,
  tracked-support leg, epsilon decomposition, and combined bound, and
  `receiptFromObservableSignatureWithPairSupport` packages it beside the
  promotion/status receipt.
- add the first concrete observable/signature receipt instance.
  `CanonicalObservableSignatureReceiptInstance` builds a minimal identity-step
  execution contract for the canonical shift state and uses it to inhabit a
  pair-support observable/signature receipt for the canonical promoted point,
  without claiming recovered dynamics or gauge/matter closure.
- add a live shift-step observable/signature receipt instance.
  `ShiftObservableSignatureReceiptInstance` adapts the existing
  `shiftContract {1}{3}` admissibility witness into the newer closure receipt
  shape, then packages the anchored
  `trajectoryGen i0 -> trajectoryGen i1`
  step with the promoted observable/signature point and decomposed pair-support
  budget.
- add a non-singleton shift-backed observable/signature pressure-test instance.
  `ShiftObservableSignaturePressureTestInstance` places the forced
  observable/signature gate over the live shift carrier and exposes the
  anchored trajectory endpoints as promotion-ready pressure points; the live
  shift receipt now uses that shift-backed promotion witness rather than the
  singleton canonical pressure point.
- refine the shift-backed pressure status so the shift carrier is no longer
  described as wholly promotion-ready.
  The status surface now discriminates promotion-ready anchored endpoints from
  held/control states while keeping the observable/signature gate wording
  theorem-thin.
- add a report-only held/control pressure surface beside the promoted receipt
  lane.  `ReceiptFromObservableSignature` now exposes
  `ObservableSignaturePressureReport`, and
  `ShiftObservableSignatureReceiptInstance` instantiates it for the
  held/control shift exit point without changing the execution receipt
  contract.
- sharpen the alternative-carrier control lane with explicit typed reports.
  `AlternativeCarrierCases` now exposes forced / held / failed case reports
  rather than leaving those statuses implied by the case labels alone.
- strengthen `ObservableGaugeEntry` so the abstract entry contract now carries
  an explicit per-state `gaugeFiber` witness in addition to observable and
  admissibility preservation.
- tighten the arithmetic Δ→Q control surface by adding
  `zeroErrorDominanceTransport` in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaQuadraticDistortion.agda`, giving a concrete
  constructor from distortion data to a bounded `DominanceTransport` witness
  with explicit finite error legs.
- tighten the canonical quadratic bottleneck by extending
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.UniqueUpToScaleSeam` with explicit
  scale-aware data (`scaleFactor`, `normalizeToScaledQ̂core`) and by exposing
  scale-aware admissibility and agreement witnesses while preserving the
  existing normalized consumer surface.
- tighten that same bottleneck again by replacing the raw `⊤` placeholder
  slots for nondegeneracy and isotropy compatibility with named
  `NondegeneracySeam` and `IsotropyCompatibilitySeam` records on
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` and `AdmissibleFor`, while keeping the
  old compatibility fields available for downstream consumers that still read
  them directly.
- strengthen those new seam records into theorem-bearing inhabitants on the
  canonical lane: `NondegeneracySeam` now records canonical origin
  normalization, `IsotropyCompatibilitySeam` now records compatibility of the
  dynamics step with `Q̂core`, and the scale path now has a
  scale-parameterized constructor plus one genuine non-unit admissible
  double-scale witness on the canonical `m = 0` lane.
- strengthen the canonical quadratic bottleneck again: `NondegeneracySeam`
  now carries full normalization to `Q̂core` and exposes a conditional strong
  nondegeneracy upgrade through `CoreAnisotropyAssumption`;
  `IsotropyCompatibilitySeam` now carries explicit shell-respecting isotropy
  structure plus a named residual action-level gap; and the non-unit scale
  witness is generalized from one hard-coded object to any strong witness with
  `dimension ≡ 0`.
- tighten those remaining canonical quadratic gaps again:
  `CoreScaleSeam` now exposes the positive-dimension non-unit scaling boundary
  explicitly and threads it into scale-aware admissibility constructors without
  pretending a positive-dimensional witness already exists;
  `CoreAnisotropyAssumption` is now reduced through the definitional bridge
  `Q̂core≡sumSq`, so the remaining anisotropy gap is stated as an explicit
  `HFZ.sumSq` zero-only-at-origin premise; and `ResidualIsotropyGap` now
  carries an action application surface plus a shell-to-action transport lift,
  so the remaining isotropy gap is unconditional inhabited transport rather
  than the older shell-only boundary.
- tighten the same seams again:
  positive-dimensional full-core `CoreScaleSeam` now has an explicit
  obstruction theorem (`positiveDimensionCoreScaleSeamForcesUnit`), and the
  remaining non-unit story is pushed onto an explicit restricted carrier
  interface (`CoreScaleCarrierSeam`); `CoreAnisotropyAssumption` is narrowed
  further to `SquareZeroResidualPremise` plus
  `SumSqZeroDecompositionPremise`, from which the older
  `CoreAnisotropyResidualPremise` is derived; and isotropy now packages a real
  inhabited action transport object (`InhabitedIsotropyTransport`) whenever a
  shell transport boundary witness is available.
- tighten the bottleneck boundary again:
  `AdmissibleFor` remains a whole-carrier surface, with
  `admissibleForCoreScaleSeam` and
  `admissibleForPositiveDimensionScaleFactorUnit` making explicit that any
  positive-dimensional admissible whole-carrier witness already forces unit
  scale; the local anisotropy kernel is now discharged through
  `squareZeroResidualTheorem` and `sumSqZeroDecompositionTheorem`, yielding
  `dischargedCoreAnisotropyAssumption` and the default strong theorem path
  `strongNondegeneracy`; and the downstream
  signature/Clifford/gauge boundary is now stated explicitly as
  normalized-quadratic-only, so unconditional shell-orbit existence is not
  part of the current consumer contract.
- extend that same explicit downstream boundary to the spin/Dirac layer via
  `spinDiracBridgeBoundary`, so the Stage-C path now states directly that it
  factors through the existing normalized-quadratic-only signature contract
  rather than implicitly relying on stronger closure facts.
- extend the same boundary one layer higher into the canonical closure stack:
  `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness` now exposes `closureQuadraticBoundary`, and
  `PhysicsClosureFullCanonicalBridgePackage` records that normalized-quadratic
  boundary explicitly beside the stored bridge witnesses. This makes the
  full-closure side honest about carrying bridge packages rather than
  consuming nondegeneracy.
- add the explicit Layer-2 separator search artifacts:
  `Ontology.Hecke.ProfileSummaryFamilySeparation` now states the honest choice
  between a separating pair and full collapse under `profileSummaryFamily`,
  `Ontology.Hecke.CurrentSaturatedProfileSummaryFamilySeparation` adds the
  saturated-branch specialization, and `scripts/profile_summary_separation.py`
  is the Python mirror over the current generator taxonomy. Replace the pure
  stub adapter with a precomputed-artifact-first
  `scripts/profile_summary_adapter.py`, add the schema example
  `artifacts/hecke/profile_summary_family.example.json`, and record that the
  remaining gap is missing materialized data rather than missing Python shape.
  Add `Docs/ClosureContractStatus.md` to record that the present downstream
  closure chain is normalized-quadratic-only.
- close that remaining materialization gap:
  `scripts/materialize_profile_summary_family.hs` now emits
  `artifacts/hecke/profile_summary_family.json` directly from the compiled
  MAlonzo bridge, and the resulting search shows that the full
  `profileSummaryFamily` invariant already separates both the full current
  nine-generator taxonomy and the saturated-only slice.
- add `scripts/minimize_profile_summary_projection.py` and record the first
  minimization result: on the current materialized artifact, each of
  `forcedStableCount`, `totalDrift`, and `contractiveCount` preserves the same
  partition as the full six-field family on both scopes. Promote
  `contractiveCount` into theorem-facing Agda surfaces via
  `Ontology.Hecke.ContractiveCountLayer2Invariant` and
  `Ontology.Hecke.CurrentSaturatedContractiveCountLayer2Invariant`, keeping
  the current claim honest: this is a current-domain Layer-2 singleton
  surface, not yet an extension-robust global minimality theorem.
  `forcedStableCount`, `totalDrift`, and `contractiveCount` alone preserves the
  same partition as the full six-field family on both the full taxonomy and
  the saturated-only slice.
- tighten `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem` by replacing the old
  `factorUniqueSeam` placeholder with an explicit generator-image uniqueness
  theorem on the universal factorization surface.
- add the canonical normalized empirical-artifact boundary for legacy
  `dashitest` HEPData outputs.
  `scripts/hepdata_artifact_schema.json` now defines the repo-native JSON
  contract, and `scripts/hepdata_adapter.py` now normalizes the old
  measurement / metrics / timeseries / certification files into that
  contract with explicit completeness and non-claim status summaries,
  without rerunning fits or fetching HEPData.
  The adapter now also prefers NPZ-backed `x/y/cov` measurement surfaces over
  covariance-free lens tables when both exist, and records per-field
  readiness for `x`, `y`, and `cov`.
- add the first thin consumer for canonical legacy HEPData artifacts.
  `scripts/hepdata_consumer.py` now loads one normalized artifact,
  selects one family payload,
  requires `empirical-artifact-ready` validation plus `x/y/cov` field
  readiness,
  and terminates at the measurement-surface carrier in
  `scripts/prototype_schema.py`
  without invoking runner, scorecard, fitting, or theorem-side logic.
- replace stem-coincidence family resolution in the legacy HEPData adapter
  with an explicit crosswalk.
  `scripts/hepdata_family_crosswalk.json`
  now records canonical family-to-measurement/metrics/timeseries/
  certification mappings, and
  `scripts/hepdata_adapter.py`
  now records family-resolution metadata in each payload instead of relying
  on stem-only inference when source families drift across stages.
- add a report-only health lane for validated HEPData measurement surfaces.
  `scripts/hepdata_surface_report.py`
  now consumes one canonical artifact and emits covariance/shape/range
  diagnostics for the extracted `MeasurementSurface` without constructing a
  `DashiStateSchema` or a `Δ` interpretation.
  The report now also exposes
  `projection_eligible`
  separately from shape-only admission and flags degraded metric carriers
  explicitly.
- add a narrow regression fixture for the HEPData family boundary.
  `tests/test_hepdata_bridge.py`
  plus
  `tests/fixtures/hepdata_family_crosswalk_fixture.json`
  now pin the canonical family mapping and the non-alias rule keeping
  `ptll_76_106_table` distinct from `pTll_76_106`.
- add the first projection-contract stub without widening the empirical
  bridge.
  `scripts/hepdata_projection_contract.py`
  and
  `Docs/MeasurementSurfaceProjectionContract.md`
  now define contract-only projection result/status surfaces and hard
  preconditions for any future
  `MeasurementSurface -> DashiStateSchema`
  lane, with no projection implementation and no theorem promotion.
- tighten that projection contract with a declared transform vocabulary.
  The contract/doc lane now pins
  `raw`,
  `gradient`,
  `whitened`,
  and
  `other-declared`
  as first-class transform names with explicit preconditions, metric-geometry
  preservation flags, regularization requirements, and downstream-use
  declarations, while still leaving projection itself unimplemented.
- add a vocabulary-enforcement helper for the transform lane.
  `scripts/hepdata_transform_validator.py`
  now validates exact transform-name membership against
  `TRANSFORM_VOCAB`
  with no alias fallback, and
  `tests/test_hepdata_transform_validator.py`
  now pins the closed vocabulary plus the canonical `raw` transform spec,
  including its comparability group.
- add a sibling-repo support note for `../dashitest` to the top-level
  `README`.
  The note now points at the strongest diagnostic and measurement-side
  surfaces there while keeping the boundary explicit that `dashitest` is a
  support repo, not a code dependency or theorem witness for this tree.
- surface the photonuclear empirical lane in the top-level `README`.
  The empirical-first owner stack is now visible from the repo entrypoint via
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalConstantsRegistry.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalMeasurementSurface.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalEvidenceSummary.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalValidationSummary.agda`, with
  `Docs/PhotonuclearEmpiricalRegistry.md` as the canonical map.
- add the photonuclear empirical validation summary surface.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalValidationSummary.agda`
  now wraps the empirical evidence summary in the thinnest repo-facing
  validation owner, with explicit status tags and counts but no physics
  claim.
- add the missing repo-facing owner for the current photonuclear empirical
  lane.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalEvidenceSummary.agda`
  now combines the constants registry and measurement surface into one
  empirical-only control surface with explicit counts and status tags, and
  `Docs/PhotonuclearEmpiricalRegistry.md`
  now records the canonical ownership map tying the Agda sidecars to the
  active script and documentation surfaces.
- refresh the newer Dashi ChatGPT URL
  `69e0cb8f-9984-8399-a5fe-d9dbffca71e3`
  again and record the corrected canonical resolution in repo context.
  The current canonical DB match for that online UUID is now
  `Dashi on Quantum Computing`
  with canonical thread ID
  `934b67438a1d7732f48b2690a3ea215077cc47c3`.
  The refreshed turns sharpen the repo-facing plan:
  keep the cancellation bridge honest,
  formalize the Goldbach lane as theorem-thin analysis objects
  (`EnergyΔ`, `GoldbachCone`, `GoldbachAmplitude`, theorem ladder),
  and keep the zeta/Riemann lane explicitly analysis-side and non-claiming.
- land the first theorem-thin Goldbach formal-object module under
  `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda`.
  The new analysis-side pack introduces:
  `EnergyΔ`,
  `GoldbachCone`,
  `GoldbachAmplitude`,
  `GoldbachTheoremLadder`,
  and
  `GoldbachProgramPack`,
  with explicit analysis-only / no-solved-Goldbach / no-solved-RH
  boundaries.
- tighten the Goldbach analysis lane with a concrete weighted-valuation
  anchor. `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda` now exports
  `weightedValuationEnergyΔ` and the canonical
  `goldbachWeightedValuationEnergyΔ` instance wired directly to
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/WeightedValuationEnergy.agda`, while still making no
  Goldbach or `Δ -> Q̂core` claim.
- add the first bounded/sample existence constructor to the Goldbach
  analysis lane.
  `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda` now exports
  `GoldbachExistenceWitness`,
  `BoundedGoldbachExistence`,
  and
  `sampleExistenceFromConeWitness`,
  so one admissible prime-pair witness can now be carried constructively
  inside the theorem-thin program surface without claiming a proof of
  universal strong Goldbach.
- instantiate the Goldbach analysis lane with one concrete sample witness.
  `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda` now adds
  `sampleGoldbachCone`,
  `sampleGoldbachExistenceWitness`,
  and
  `sampleGoldbachBoundedExistence`
  for the explicit `2 + 2 = 4` sample on the weighted-valuation energy
  surface.
- extend the Goldbach analysis lane with a second nontrivial sample witness.
  `DASHI/Analysis/GoldbachFormalObjects.agda` now also adds
  `sampleGoldbachCone8`,
  `sampleGoldbachExistenceWitness8`,
  and
  `sampleGoldbachBoundedExistence8`
  for the explicit `3 + 5 = 8` sample.
- tighten the Goldbach theorem ladder so existence is no longer a bare
  theorem-thin `Set`.
  `GoldbachTheoremLadder.existenceSurface` now requires a
  `BoundedGoldbachExistence`
  witness on the corresponding cone, matching the fact that the analysis lane
  now carries concrete sample-side witnesses.
- extend the zeta analysis lane with one concrete derived observation over
  the current Abel-summed sample surface.
  `DASHI/Analysis/ZetaVisualization.agda` now exports
  `ZetaBoundaryContrastView` and
  `mkBoundaryContrastView`,
  which compute the exact sample-to-sample eta and zeta boundary deltas from
  `AbelZetaSamplingSurface` while still making no RH, zero-finder, or
  critical-line interpolation claim.
- extend the zeta analysis lane with a second concrete derived observation.
  `DASHI/Analysis/ZetaVisualization.agda` now also exports
  `ZetaEtaTransferView` and
  `mkEtaTransferView`,
  which compute the exact eta-to-zeta transfer gaps at the current sampled
  indices while still making no RH, zero-finder, or Euler-product claim.
- add the first constructive witness object for the current three-body
  branching lane under
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/BoundaryGeneratedBranchingWitness.agda`.
  The new record packages one boundary state, one generated branch member,
  one regime label, one basin-anchored branch state, and one observed regime
  weight into a typed witness sourced from the existing
  `PredictabilityTheorem`,
  `Interference`,
  and
  `BundleIntensity`
  surfaces, without claiming a solved chaos theorem.
- tighten that three-body branching witness so the chosen branch member is
  explicitly identified with the theorem-generated boundary branch.
  `BoundaryGeneratedBranchingWitness.agda` now carries the field
  `branchMemberMatchesGeneratedBoundary`
  instead of leaving the witness object and theorem-generated branch only
  side-by-side.
- refresh the newer Dashi ChatGPT URL
  `69e0cb8f-9984-8399-a5fe-d9dbffca71e3`
  into the canonical archive and record the updated resolution metadata in
  repo context.
  The canonical DB thread still resolves as
  `Coprime Primes and DeltaInteraction`
  with canonical thread ID
  `e4a817086446a12712a5a150254f6ae79f8c566b`;
  the later turns sharpen that the current cancellation-energy bridge
  remains an explicit witness-gated lane through
  `TransportPreservesCancellationPressure theorem dim≡15`,
  while the intended next closure candidate is a separate weighted valuation
  measurement layer
  `Φ(x) = (v_p(x) * sqrt(log p))_p`
  and
  `Q₊(x) = Σ_p v_p(x)^2 log p`
  feeding the existing contraction-derived quadratic/signature stack.
- sync the top-level Stage C notes and TODO frontier to that refreshed
  reading.
  The repo docs now distinguish the current concrete cancellation-pressure
  transport seam from the proposed weighted valuation lane, instead of
  implying that the current tracked-profile transport already proves the
  full `Δ -> Q̂core` bridge.
- land the first constructive weighted valuation helper lane in code.
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/WeightedValuationEnergy.agda` now packages tracked-prime
  valuation vectors, weighted valuation energies, weighted quadratic energies,
  and `Vec ℤ 15` transport helpers for the future `Φ/Q₊` bridge.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda` now consumes that
  lane as a separate `WeightedValuationMeasurementCandidate` surface without
  pretending it already proves the canonical quadratic bridge.
- tighten the weighted-valuation forward lane into a record-level witness
  surface.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda` now adds
  `canonicalValuationTransport`,
  `WeightedValuationTransportCompatibility`,
  and
  `WeightedValuationForwardCandidate`
  so the weighted lane can carry transport coherence, candidate-level
  admissibility, and weighted-quadratic agreement without claiming an
  identification with `Q̂core`.
- tighten the cancellation-pressure seam to match the audited code reality.
  The bridge module now exposes the honest profile-side equality
  `pairCancellationEnergyMatchesEmbeddedProfileScore`, while the stronger
  cancellation-to-canonical-quadratic identification remains explicit as an
  external assumption surface because the current tracked-profile transport
  lifts lane values directly but `Q̂core` evaluates `Σ lane²`.
- replace the bare cancellation-pressure theorem alias with a record-level
  compatibility surface.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda`
  now exposes
  `CancellationPressureCompatibility`
  and
  `canonicalCancellationPressureCompatibility`
  so the cancellation lane records:
  pressure bridge,
  arithmetic energy,
  transport,
  and the external `pressurePreserved` witness explicitly,
  while keeping any `Δ -> Q̂core` identification out of scope.
- give the weaker profile-side seam its own arithmetic owner.
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/ArithmeticPrimeProfileBridge.agda`
  now exposes
  `EmbeddedPrimeProfileMeasurement`,
  and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda`
  now exposes
  `EmbeddedProfileScoreCompatibility`
  plus
  `canonicalEmbeddedProfileScoreCompatibility`,
  making the honest
  `deltaSum -> embeddedProfileScore`
  lane explicit without pretending it is already the theorem-side quadratic.
- add the next thin signature/Clifford packaging adapter on top of the
  existing closure stack.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda`
  now exposes
  `DeltaQuadraticSignatureCliffordPackage`
  and
  `deltaBridgeToSignatureCliffordPackage`,
  letting an existing delta bridge carry its normalized quadratic,
  inherited signature-31 data,
  and a specialized Clifford presentation handle
  without introducing a new derivation or widening the cancellation claim.
- add a theorem-thin three-body boundary-of-contraction scaffold under
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/`.
  The new namespace packages:
  `State`,
  `Step`,
  `Regime`,
  `Energy`,
  `Wave`,
  and `Bridge`
  as the repo-native surface for treating the three-body problem as a
  non-globally-contracting system with cone-boundary dynamics.
  The scaffold explicitly stops at state/operator packaging, local
  energy/action, regime classification, and a wave-facing admissible-path
  kernel; it does not claim a closed-form solver or a completed chaos theorem.
- extend that three-body scaffold with an explicit prediction layer.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictiveBoundary.agda` now adds
  `Delta3Body`,
  `EnergyΔ3`,
  `Action3`,
  `LocalPredictiveHorizon`,
  `ChaosBoundary`,
  and `ThreeBodyPredictiveBoundaryLayer`.
  This makes the repo-native claim precise:
  better observations improve local state/regime estimates, while
  non-contracting regions still bound long-horizon forecast reliability.
- extend the same three-body namespace with an interference/path-family layer.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/Interference.agda` now adds theorem-thin surfaces
  for path families, regime amplitudes, regime weights, regime distributions,
  and boundary-generated branching.
  This lets the repo state the next stronger claim cleanly:
  chaotic three-body evolution is modeled not as total loss of structure, but
  as an action-weighted interference pattern over admissible future regimes.
- anchor the new three-body predictive surface to one existing repo-native
  status witness rather than leaving it purely nominal.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictiveBoundary.agda` now imports
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.Basin` and ties
  `LocalPredictiveHorizon`
  to a concrete
  `Basin State`
  through
  `basinSurface`
  and
  `basinForecastCompatibility`.
  This keeps the local-horizon story precise:
  the current forecast surface is now explicitly basin-relative and
  eventual-stability-facing, without pretending the repo already proves a
  stronger global chaos or Lyapunov theorem for three-body dynamics.
- anchor the theorem-thin three-body bridge to that same basin-facing
  admissibility surface.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/Bridge.agda`
  now carries
  `basinPredictionSurface`
  plus
  `basinPredictionCompatible`,
  keeping the bridge aligned with
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictiveBoundary.agda`
  instead of introducing a second bridge-local admissibility notion.
- expose that basin-anchored three-body bridge at the theorem-surface
  entrypoint and make the bridge carry the predictive-horizon projection
  explicitly.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/Bridge.agda`
  now also carries
  `predictiveHorizonSurface`
  plus
  `predictiveHorizonCompatible`,
  and
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/TheoremSurface.agda`
  now publicly re-exports the bridge alongside the theorem-thin predictability
  surfaces.
- add a repo-native theorem-surface layer for the three-body lane instead of
  leaving the simulation/theorem connection only in chat prose.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictabilityTheorem.agda`
  now packages theorem-thin surfaces for:
  cone preservation,
  local strict contraction,
  local Lyapunov descent,
  basin-relative predictive horizon,
  boundary counterexample,
  interior coherence,
  boundary branching,
  and regime-weight convergence.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/TheoremSurface.agda`
  is the thin public entrypoint for that lane.
- add an analysis-side zeta visualization scaffold aligned with the new
  three-body bundle/intensity reading.
  `DASHI/Analysis/ZetaVisualization.agda`
  now carries:
  `CriticalLineMagnitude`,
  `PhaseFlow`,
  `ZeroSpacing`,
  `ProjectedZetaFeatureView`,
  and
  `ZetaVisualizationPack`.
  This lives under `Analysis`, not `Physics`, and is explicitly
  visualization-only:
  no RH proof, zero-finding engine, or spectral-closure theorem is claimed.
- tighten the new three-body theorem surface by replacing one remaining raw
  placeholder with a concrete boundary-branching witness.
  `DASHI/Physics/ThreeBody/PredictabilityTheorem.agda`
  now defines
  `BoundaryBranchingCompatibility State Energy Phase`
  to pin theorem-level boundary branching to the existing
  `BoundaryGeneratedBranching`
  surfaces already exported by the interference and bundle/intensity layers.
  The same theorem surface now uses the existing
  `ThreeBodyRegimeDistribution`
  record directly for regime-weight convergence instead of another dependent
  `Set` placeholder.
- ground the zeta visualization lane on exact repo values rather than only a
  type shell.
  `DASHI/Analysis/ZetaVisualization.agda`
  now carries
  `AbelZetaSamplingSurface`
  with explicit equality witnesses tying the visualization anchor values
  back to
  `eta0`,
  `etaMinus1`,
  `zeta0`,
  and
  `zetaMinus1`
  from
  `DASHI/Analysis/AbelZeta.agda`.
- add stable README-facing image copies for the current three-body and zeta
  visualization lanes under
  `Docs/Images/three-body/`
  and
  `Docs/Images/zeta/`,
  and document them in `README.md` with:
  provenance,
  formalism sources,
  intended reading,
  and explicit non-claim boundaries.

## 2026-04-17

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalConstantsRegistry.agda`
  as the repo-native photonuclear/LHC empirical constants registry.
  The new surface records the reduced surrogate defaults and example-derived
  values with explicit provenance strings and claim-boundary tags, so the
  empirical side stays clearly separated from physics claims or fits.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhotonuclearEmpiricalMeasurementSurface.agda`
  and align the photonuclear docs with it.
  The LHC lane now has an explicit measurement-side packaging surface for
  measured observables, per-sample payloads, and in-scope/out-of-scope claim
  bookkeeping, and the bridge/capstone notes now point to both that surface
  and the constants registry as provenance sidecars rather than proof-bearing
  physics modules.

## 2026-04-15

- add the missing `AdmissibleFor` abstraction to
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`, along with
  `admissibleForFromStrong` and `admissibleForNormalization`, so the strong
  quadratic witness can be packaged under the admissible surface the thread
  described.
- thread that admissible quadratic packaging into
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.agda` by carrying
  `dynamicsMap` and `admissibleQuadratic` on the theorem surface, and update
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  to read normalization through the theorem-level admissible package.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda` as the first
  compile-thin `Δ -> quadratic` bridge surface.
  The new module does not introduce a second normalization path; it packages
  a Delta-side quadratic candidate as a theorem-level admissible object and
  reuses `canonicalOutputAgreement` plus `AdmissibleFor.uniqueUpToScale` to
  compare it pointwise with the canonical contraction-derived quadratic.
- extend that same module with an explicit `DeltaQuadraticCandidate` layer and
  the first concrete integer-pair arithmetic stub.
  The new candidate surface separates:
  integer-pair pressure bridge,
  arithmetic energy in `ℤ`,
  state transport into the quadratic carrier,
  transported energy/quadratic coherence,
  and admissibility.
  The first stub uses cancellation energy on
  `DeltaPair = Int × Int`, adds inherited signature projections on both
  Delta-side records, and implements the tracked-carrier transport
  concretely from the arithmetic prime-profile vector under the explicit
  theorem-side witness `dimension ≡ 15`.
  The remaining cancellation-to-quadratic identification is now exposed as
  the explicit constructor input
  `TransportPreservesCancellationPressure theorem dim≡15`,
  so the file no longer hides that gap behind a module-level postulate.
- sync the repo-facing arithmetic notes with the currently landed tracked
  pressure / interaction implementation.
  The tracked carrier now lives canonically in `DASHI/TrackedPrimes.agda`,
  base coprime evidence is centralized in
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/TrackedCoprimeTable.agda`,
  and `DASHI/Arithmetic/CoprimeLayer.agda` now discharges the smallest
  honest tracked seam:
  `distinctTrackedPrimePowersCoprime`.
- record the currently landed interaction and packaging surfaces in the repo
  notes:
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/DeltaInteraction.agda` now carries the one-lane and
  two-lane budget surfaces,
  `DASHI/Arithmetic/EpsilonBound.agda` exports the explicit tracked constant
  `trackedPrimeLogConstant = logNat 71` plus
  `explicitTrackedEpsilonBound`,
  and `DASHI/Arithmetic/PartialResult.agda` re-exports the combined theorem
  bundle.
- extend the recorded diagnostics status for
  `scripts/check_prime_profile_counterexample_search.py`:
  threshold counts, pair-threshold summaries, threshold signatures, and
  shared-budget decay/grouping are now part of the canonical report shape,
  with no flagged counterexample on the current canonical sample states.
- run `robust-context-fetch` for the requested ChatGPT URLs and record the
  result in repo context.
  The JMD thread
  `69c4a9b1-d014-83a0-8bb0-873e4eaa4098`
  resolves from the canonical archive DB as
  `JMD FORMAL EXPLAIN - Meme System Explanation`
  with canonical thread ID
  `c6e383233d0d7c4efde671be1432c825054cb222`.
  The Dashi thread
  `69de4fb3-c3e4-839e-aea4-08b086794879`
  now also resolves from the canonical archive DB as
  `Coprime Primes and DeltaInteraction`
  with canonical thread ID
  `e4a817086446a12712a5a150254f6ae79f8c566b`
  after a clean serial refresh inserted `83` messages and merged `6`
  duplicates.

## 2026-04-06

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/LilaDashiBridge.agda` as the first repo-native
  LILA-to-DASHI bridge stub.
  The module packages the existing execution contract together with the
  canonical receipt-layer phase split, so the repo now has a named seam for
  reading LILA as the execution system and DASHI as the admissibility lens.
  Sync `Docs/LILA_DASHI_Bridge.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md`
  so the bridge reading is recorded once in prose and once in code.
- add `scripts/delta_cone_lila.py`, `scripts/checkpoint_prime_vectors.py`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/LilaTraceFamily.agda` to turn the bridge into a
  runnable analyzer plus a minimal trace-family lift.
  The scripts operationalize the delta-cone test and the prime-exponent
  checkpoint encoding; the Agda module gives the first trace-row schema that
  can be lifted back into the execution-contract seam.
- add `scripts/run_compare.sh` and `scripts/plot_training_dynamics.py` to
  match the thread's latest recommendation for a minimal credibility package:
  baseline-vs-LILA comparison plus simple training-dynamics plots.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/BadModeSuppression.agda` and thread that receipt-side surface through `LilaDashiBridge.agda` so the empirical bad-mode suppression metrics now have a named formal stub: measured bad mass, a coherence gate, and a non-increasing-after-coherence target.
- tighten the bridge UX with `scripts/run_all.sh`, parameterized model
  entrypoints in `scripts/run_compare.sh`, and a short repo-facing usage page
  plus PlantUML flow diagram in `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.md` and
  `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.puml`, with the rendered preview in
  `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.svg`.

## 2026-04-05

- add `scripts/run_agda_easy_to_hard.py` as the simple front-door runner for
  the current validated Agda sequence.
  It executes the known cheap targets in easiest-to-hardest order:
  `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda`,
  `Kernel/Monoid.agda`,
  `Verification/Prelude.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelectionBridge.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeInvariance.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeConcentration.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeIsolation.agda`,
  with optional bounded inclusion of
  `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda`
  and optional Layer 2 queue generation at the end.
  Sync `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md` and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  intended “easy -> bounded -> queue-only” flow explicitly.

## 2026-04-03

- add `scripts/build_selector_step_coarse_bundle.py` as the first repo-native
  bundle builder for the still-open selector commutation probe.
  It reuses the existing Agda-backed orientation-prime adapter from
  `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` and emits a
  `coarse_step` / `step_coarse` bundle suitable for
  `scripts/check_selector_step_coarse.py`, with optional inline comparison
  output.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the correct
  boundary:
  this is a bridge-aligned runtime probe built from repo-native source, not a
  full independent evaluator of the `shiftCoarse` / `shiftStep` schedule.

- add `scripts/check_selector_step_coarse.py` as a cheap runtime probe for the
  still-open selector commutation theorem.
  It compares two concrete `MoonshinePrimeState` payloads already interpreted
  as `coarse(step(x))` and `step(coarse(x))`, then reports whether the
  explicit selector agrees on both sides.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the correct
  boundary explicitly:
  this script is for bounded evidence / counterexample search, not theorem
  discharge.

- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda` from a pure
  target surface into a theorem-bearing selector lane.
  The selector is now explicit on the 15-prime carrier:
  highest exponent, lowest prime on ties.
  `selector-sound` is discharged in Agda by a finite upper-bound proof over
  the SSP carrier, while `selector-no-loss-target` and
  `selector-step-coarse-target` remain the honest open targets.
  Recheck `scripts/select_canonical_prime.py` against the same rule and sync
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md`.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda` and
  `scripts/select_canonical_prime.py` as the next thin selector surface above
  exponent-level concentration.
  The new Agda module packages the remaining selection boundary explicitly as
  selector soundness, selector no-loss under admissible descent, and
  selector/coarse-step commutation targets.
  The new runtime helper implements the current explicit selector rule:
  highest exponent, lowest prime on ties.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the selection
  gap as a concrete selector theorem problem rather than a vague concentration
  story.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeConcentration.agda` and
  `scripts/check_canonical_prime_concentration.py` as the first exponent-level
  concentration surface above the carrier/bridge/support layers.
  The new Agda module defines
  `PrimeWeight`,
  `PrimeDominates`,
  and `PrimeConcentrated` on the canonical 15-prime carrier, proves weight
  transport across the already-landed coarse/step commutation law, and keeps
  the actual selective claims explicit as target surfaces:
  existence of a concentrated prime and no-loss of concentration under the
  current execution admissibility boundary.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records that the next
  gap is now exponent-level concentration rather than support-level
  invariance.

- add `scripts/route_agda_by_layer.py` as a small execution-policy helper
  above the existing Agda validation and Layer 2 queue surfaces.
  It classifies modules into `L0/L1/L2` and routes them to:
  interactive direct runs,
  bounded direct runs,
  or queue-only handoff for the current heavy Hecke Layer 2 lane.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  control-plane rule explicitly:
  the main win is choosing the right execution boundary around Agda, not
  pretending the heavy aggregate modules belong in the interactive loop.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeInvariance.agda` as the first
  light support-level theorem layer above the new canonical prime-selection
  bridge.
  The new module proves transport of prime support across the already-landed
  coarse/step commutation law for the transported prime embedding, and it
  also proves the current support-level no-growth statement over the existing
  execution-admissibility boundary.
  The stronger whole-vector / selective MDL concentration story remains open;
  the new module is intentionally support-level rather than a premature
  prime-image equality claim.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the sharper
  selection boundary correctly.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelectionBridge.agda` and
  `scripts/check_canonical_prime_selection_bridge.py` as the first real
  implementation of the canonical prime-selection/signature bridge sketched in
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`.
  The new Agda module packages the currently theorem-bearing closure-side
  pieces:
  prime witness on the transported 15-lane carrier,
  coarse/step commutation for the transported prime embedding,
  coarse/step commutation for the transported Hecke signature,
  and the current lower-bound bridge
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_hist`.
  The stronger MDL concentration and non-accidental isolation clauses remain
  explicit open targets there.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo records the exact new boundary correctly.

- add `Ontology/Hecke/MoonshinePrimeCarrierMatch.agda` and
  `scripts/check_monster_prime_carrier_match.py` so the repo can now test the
  legal carrier-level version of “our 15 are those 15” without touching the
  heavy Hecke long-compute lane.
  The new Agda surface proves that the intrinsic `SSP` carrier is exactly the
  canonical 15-prime Monster/Ogg list
  `2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,41,47,59,71`, and the Python script checks
  the same equality against the runtime-side catalog.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/MoonshineMatch.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  correct boundary explicitly:
  carrier/catalog equality is now implemented, while the stronger claim
  equating `forcedStableCount = 15` with the Ogg/Monster prime set remains
  open.

- extend `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` again so emitted
  batch directories are self-indexing.
  It now writes `index.txt` and `index.json` alongside the shell,
  offline-heavy, by-pair, and by-stage artifacts, so external runners or
  humans can inspect the full batch layout from one place.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  self-indexing batch artifact layout explicitly.

- extend `scripts/render_layer2_batch_commands.py` with a small `--dedupe`
  mode so repeated identical command lines can collapse to a unique offline
  command list while preserving first-seen order.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records both
  rendered-script mode and deduped-command mode explicitly.

- add `scripts/render_layer2_batch_commands.py` as the last small control-plane
  wrapper after queue emission.
  It consumes a Layer 2 batch JSON artifact and renders either raw command
  lines or a runnable bash script, so offline handoff no longer requires
  manually extracting `command_template` entries.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  shell -> queue artifact -> rendered command-list flow explicitly.

- extend `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` so it can now write
  concrete batch artifacts to disk, not just print combined output.
  The emitter now materializes:
  `shell.{txt,json}`,
  `offline-heavy.{txt,json}`,
  and grouped offline-heavy files by pair and by stage.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  new offline handoff mode explicitly while keeping the script queue-only.

- refine `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` so it now emits
  separate compile-thin and offline-heavy batches instead of one flat queue.
  The shell batch is centered on
  `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda`;
  the offline-heavy batch keeps the current three predicted pairs in
  `sector -> package -> correlation`
  order. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  sharper shell-first / replay-later control flow explicitly.

- add `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` as the control-plane
  emitter for the current saturated Layer 2 speedrun.
  It externalizes the fixed three-pair proof order and the stage order
  `sector -> package -> correlation`, and can attach optional
  `agda --parallel` command templates without running the heavy proof lane.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the next practical use of the sibling
  `../agda` performance ideas correctly:
  bounded deterministic queueing first, heavy replay later.

- add `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda` as the true compile-thin
  Layer 2 control surface.
  Unlike `Layer2FiniteSearch.agda`, the shell does not import the heavy
  histogram lane; it postulates the fixed pair/stage targets and packages the
  current order only. Extend
  `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda`
  so `Layer2Open` now carries both:
  the compile-thin shell and the heavier logical finite-search package.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the distinction explicitly:
  logical thinness is not compile thinness, and only the shell is a safe
  interactive Agda check.

- add `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearch.agda` as a thin bounded-search
  package over the already-landed Layer 2 proof order.
  It does not add a new Hecke summary surface; it packages the current
  fixed-domain speedrun exactly as
  `sector -> package -> correlation`
  on the three predicted saturated-class pairs.
  Extend `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda` so
  `Layer2Open` now carries that finite search program explicitly.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the new method boundary correctly:
  the useful lesson from the sibling `../agda` tree is bounded
  proposal/replay-style finite search, not a new invariant layer and not a
  reason to re-run the heavy histogram modules interactively.

- stop treating the old ultrametric signature screen as the execution
  acceptance boundary inside `scripts/regime_test.py`.
  Keep `structural_ok` as a diagnostic field, but switch `joint_ok` and
  `status_class` onto the actual execution-contract clauses the harness
  computes:
  cone,
  MDL/Fejér,
  basin,
  eigen,
  together with arrow.
  Also export the new contract-facing fields (`cone_ok`, `mdl_ok`,
  `execution_non_arrow_ok`, `legacy_*`) so downstream JSON and family
  summaries can distinguish the real acceptance boundary from the old
  signature filter.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo records that `regime_test.py` is now on the same
  execution boundary as the new closure-CSV runner.

- wire the new closure-CSV execution-contract runner into the existing batch
  analysis path rather than leaving it as a standalone entrypoint.
  Refactor `scripts/run_execution_contract_on_closure_csv.py` into reusable
  evaluation helpers and extend `scripts/tail_boundary_batch.py` so each
  compatible dataset now records projected-delta execution receipts alongside
  the existing tail-boundary family summaries.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo now records the narrower remaining gap correctly:
  the runner integration is landed, and the residual screening drift lives
  deeper in the older analysis surfaces such as `scripts/regime_test.py`.

- make projection and basin first-class closure-side execution objects rather
  than leaving them only as free predicates inside the contract.
  Add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Projection.agda` for the explicit projection
  carrier plus projected-delta compatibility, add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Basin.agda` for the attractor-relative basin object
  on the projected carrier, and refactor
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionContract.agda` to consume both directly
  while preserving the readable receipt layer in
  `ExecutionContractLaws.agda`.
  Add `scripts/run_execution_contract_on_closure_csv.py` as the dedicated
  runtime adapter on top of `scripts/execution_contract.py`, so the repo now
  has an explicit closure-CSV execution-contract entrypoint instead of only a
  reusable core enforcer.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo records the new boundary correctly:
  projection and basin are now explicit contract objects, and the remaining
  execution gap is no longer “add a runner” but “instantiate these objects
  with richer source-sensitive witnesses”.

## 2026-04-02

- refine the physics-side execution contract instead of inventing a parallel
  execution surface. Add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionContractLaws.agda` as a readable receipt/law
  layer above the already-landed `ExecutionContract.agda`, making the five
  obligations explicit:
  arrow,
  projected-delta cone,
  MDL,
  basin,
  eigen overlap.
  Add `scripts/execution_contract.py` as the matching Python projected-delta
  enforcement surface for `closure_embedding_per_step.csv`-style traces. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  execution boundary correctly:
  admissibility is a delta-step contract, not a global `Q(x)` descent rule
  and not a `j-fixed` trace-preservation rule.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/TriadSectorCorrelationRefinement.agda` as the next
  fixed-domain fallback above the ordered triad histogram, and extend
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda` so the same
  three predicted Layer 2 pairs now carry correlation comparison targets as
  well as sector/package histogram targets. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the next refinement step explicitly:
  if the triad-histogram lane collapses, move to sector-correlation rather
  than introducing more totals or broadening the taxonomy.
- re-resolve the canonical archived thread
  `Dashi and Physics Insights`
  (`69ca43a9-09fc-839b-8cc3-e5ce3868eef5`,
  canonical ID `ad17536d8eeb320106585654a0950424abafa93b`, source `db`) and
  sync the repo boundary against it. Record in
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` that its earlier `Forced-Stable Transfer Bridge` priority is now
  historical provenance for the previous bridge phase, while the current live
  bottleneck is the fixed-domain Layer 2 separator problem on the saturated
  branch. Extend `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda` so
  the packaged Layer 2 status now includes the explicit predicted proof order
  from `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda`.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the exact Layer 2 proof order and add
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda`. The repo
  now records the recommended fixed-domain comparison sequence explicitly:
  `balancedCycle` vs `supportCascade`,
  `balancedComposed` vs `supportCascade`, then
  `denseComposed` vs `fullSupportCascade`, all tested sector-by-sector before
  whole-package triad comparison. Keep this comparison surface on the same
  long-compute lane as the other histogram refinement modules.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the current progress boundary:
  record explicitly that the repo is now in a "Layer 1 closed / Layer 2 open"
  state. On the current taxonomy, the coarse
  `generator -> collapse class -> stay refinement -> exact p2 pressure`
  story is complete; the only live mathematical bottleneck is the next
  separating invariant `I₂` on the current saturated branch. Keep the
  histogram/triad-indexed refinement lane on the long-compute list and avoid
  reframing the repo as a total theory before that branch is discharged.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda` to package the
  current Hecke-side status boundary explicitly: Layer 1 is closed on the
  current taxonomy (`generator -> collapse class -> stay refinement -> exact
  p2 pressure`), while Layer 2 remains open on the fixed current saturated
  branch (`next separating invariant`). Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo now records the closed-vs-open split directly rather
  than only in prose.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedSectorHistogramComputations.agda` as
  the concrete packaged-data companion to the current fixed-domain
  triad-histogram lane. The module freezes the scope to the already-known
  saturated generator classes and exposes named three-sector histogram
  packages plus the next proof targets in the right order:
  single-sector separation, full packaged separation, or total collapse of
  the packaged refinement on the current scope. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so this module is recorded as a long-compute implementation
  surface rather than an interactively revalidated theorem.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedTriadHistogramSeparation.agda` as the
  current-scope specialization of the triad-indexed refinement lane. The new
  module freezes the domain to the already-classified saturated generator
  taxonomy and states the next honest theorem target there:
  either the triad-indexed histogram separates some current saturated classes,
  or that refinement is exhausted too. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so this fixed-domain triad-histogram question is recorded as the
  next long-compute item rather than an interactively revalidated theorem.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the `3 × 5` refinement boundary:
  record that `Ontology/Hecke/TriadIndexedDefectOrbitSummaryRefinement.agda`
  now exists as the next candidate refinement surface above the flat current
  orbit-summary histogram, and that
  `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableCountDecomposition.agda` now carries both the
  additive `9 + 6` candidate and the multiplicative `3 × 5` factorization on
  the current saturated branch. Keep those Agda checks on the long-compute
  list rather than re-running them interactively.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the current `15`-decomposition boundary:
  record that `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitSummaryRefinement.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableCountDecomposition.agda` now exist as the first
  implementation surfaces above the collapsed current saturated
  `DefectOrbitSummary`, but that their Agda checks should be treated as
  long-compute items rather than re-run interactively after the prior
  session instability on this class of check.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the current saturated `p2` boundary:
  record that `3` is the generative ternary radix while `15` is only the
  current emergent saturated value of the fixed-prime orbit-summary surface.
  The next structural hypothesis is now stated explicitly as explaining or
  decomposing that `15` (for example by a candidate `9 + 6` split), rather
  than treating `15` itself as primitive.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedOrbitSummaryCollapse.agda` to
  strengthen the current saturated-side negative theorem from the
  `forcedStableCount` field to the whole current `DefectOrbitSummary` at
  `p2`. On the full current saturated generator set, the orbit summary
  already collapses to the same fully stable tuple `(15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)`.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: the next honest separator
  must come from a richer Hecke-side summary/package than the currently
  landed `DefectOrbitSummary`, or from genuinely new generator classes.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentGeneratorPersistenceRefinement.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedForcedStableCollapse.agda` to lift the
  current Hecke-side persistence boundary from the original certified finite
  subset to the full current generator taxonomy. The first module gives every
  currently landed generator class an explicit refinement and exact `p2`
  orbit-pressure value, with `supportCascade` now joining the saturated stay
  branch. The second module packages the matching negative theorem on the
  same scope: every currently saturated generator class already has
  `forcedStableCount = 15`, so the present `forcedStableCount`-based summary
  is exhausted as a splitter on the whole current taxonomy. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: find a richer Hecke-side
  summary/package that separates the saturated side, or extend the law only
  when genuinely new generator classes land.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SupportCascadePersistence.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedSaturatedForcedStableCollapse.agda` to push both
  active Hecke-side seams one step further. The first extends the current
  persistence story beyond the original certified finite quotient by proving
  that the mixed-scale `supportCascade` stay-class also has exact
  `forcedStableCount = 15` at `p2`. The second packages the matching negative
  fact on the current saturated certified side: every representative there
  already has `forcedStableCount = 15`, so the present orbit-summary
  factorization through that field cannot separate the saturated classes any
  further. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is
  stated correctly: either extend the `(collapseTime, stayRefinement)` law
  beyond the original certified set, or find a richer Hecke-side summary that
  splits the saturated side.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/DefectPersistenceRefinement.agda` as the next honest
  theorem layer above the certified representative persistence quotient. The
  current exact `p2` data now lands as an explicit refinement law:
  collapse time alone does not determine exact Hecke-side orbit pressure, but
  collapse time plus one Hecke-derived stay refinement does. On the current
  certified set, `explicitWidth1` is `lowStay`,
  `explicitWidth3` and `denseComposed` are `highStay`,
  and the current anchored/immediate representatives are `nonStay`. Also
  extend `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` to
  re-export the corresponding certified refinement factorization through the
  full `DefectOrbitSummary`. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is
  stated correctly: lift this `(collapseTime, stayRefinement)` law beyond the
  current certified set or split the still-saturated side with a richer
  Hecke-side summary than `forcedStableCount` alone.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedRepresentativeOrbitSummaryPersistence.agda`
  to lift the current certified representative persistence quotient through
  the full Hecke-side `DefectOrbitSummary`. On the current certified set, the
  persistence tier is now recovered by projecting the summary's
  `forcedStableCount` field, and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` now re-exports the
  corresponding certified representative orbit-summary factorization. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: lift these Hecke-determined
  certified quotients beyond the current finite set or separate the current
  saturated classes with a richer summary.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedRepresentativePersistence.agda` as the first
  genuinely collapse-free numeric quotient on the current certified
  representative set. The exact Hecke-side `forcedStableCountOrbitP2` count
  now determines a small persistence tier on that finite domain:
  `explicitWidth1` lands in `reducedPersistence`, while the rest of the
  current certified anchored/immediate plus the other current stay
  representatives land in `saturatedPersistence`. Also strengthen
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` with a certified
  representative orbit-count factorization through that Hecke-determined
  count band. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is
  stated correctly: lift this quotient beyond the current certified set or
  replace it with a richer Hecke-determined persistence/summary theorem.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/StaysVsImmediateRepresentativeOrder.agda` as the first
  tiny discharged numeric witness layer above the current exact `p2` count
  modules. The current certified `staysOneMoreStep` representatives are now
  proved `≤` the current certified `immediateExit` representatives at the
  `p2` forced-stable orbit-count level; the same is now true for the current
  `exitToAnchored` representatives; and the guarded orbit-pressure predicates
  in `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` are concretely discharged
  on those certified sets. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated
  correctly: move from exact representative counts plus current discharged
  order witnesses to a genuinely Hecke-determined numeric persistence or
  quotient law.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ExitToAnchoredRepresentativeComputations.agda` and
  strengthen `Ontology/Hecke/ImmediateExitRepresentativeComputations.agda`
  plus `Ontology/Hecke/StaysOneMoreStepRepresentativeComputations.agda` with
  exact current `p2` count theorems. The three current collapse classes are
  now all represented explicitly on the Hecke side:
  current `immediateExit` and `exitToAnchored` representatives normalize to
  `illegalCountP2 = 15` and `forcedStableCountOrbitP2 = 15`, while the
  current `staysOneMoreStep` branch splits as
  `explicitWidth1 ↦ forcedStableCountOrbitP2 = 2` and
  `explicitWidth3, denseComposed ↦ 15`. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated precisely: discharge the guarded
  pressure predicates from these exact count modules instead of searching for
  more representative-state scaffolding.
- extend `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` with
  assumption-guarded theorem surfaces above the current concrete instances,
  and add `Ontology/Hecke/ImmediateExitRepresentativeComputations.agda` so
  the immediate-exit branch mirrors the already-landed stay-class
  representative computations. The pressure-order module now exposes guarded
  numeric orbit-pressure predicates, while the factorization module now
  exposes guarded defect-summary factorization predicates for a future
  Hecke-determined quotient. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated
  precisely: discharge those success predicates with concrete `p2`
  representative computations instead of adding more coarse scaffolding.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/StaysOneMoreStepRepresentativeComputations.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` above the current
  collapse-to-pressure scaffold. The first module enumerates the current
  certified `staysOneMoreStep` classes through the representative-state
  bridge, exposing their representative state, transported prime image,
  computed `p2` orbit summary, and inherited low-pressure tier. The second
  adds the first theorem-bearing order law on the coarse pressure surface:
  `staysOneMoreStep ≤ exitToAnchored ≤ immediateExit`. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: move from coarse pressure
  order to genuinely Hecke-determined numeric persistence or quotient laws.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapsePressure.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` above the new
  collapse-time surface. The first module packages a coarse Hecke-side
  pressure classification and representative `p2` pressure summaries above
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapseBridge.agda`; the second lands the first
  explicit factorization scaffold from collapse time through that coarse
  defect-pressure summary. Also tighten the comment in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCollapseTime.agda` so `unknownCollapse`
  is recorded as reserved for future classes rather than describing the now
  fully classified current generator set. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated
  correctly: strengthen the current collapse-to-pressure dictionary into a
  genuinely Hecke-determined persistence or quotient theorem.
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorFourthStepBoundary.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorTaxonomy.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCollapseTime.agda` to close the last
  prefix-side classification hole: `explicitWidth1` is no longer
  `boundaryUnknown`, because the one-hot branch stays in the same
  `π-mdl-max` fibre for one more live step. The collapse-time surface is now
  a coarse three-way observable on the current generator classes:
  `immediateExit`, `exitToAnchored`, and `staysOneMoreStep`. Also add
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapseBridge.agda` as the first honest
  Hecke-side bridge from that observable: one representative live state per
  generator class, plus the already-proved
  `illegalCount <= forcedStableCount_orbit` lower bound at `p2`. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so follow-on work can refine collapse time or strengthen the
  Hecke bridge without restating the current theorem boundary.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorTaxonomy.agda` to connect
  the normalized same-fibre prefix branch and the normalized mixed-scale
  branch into one higher-level generator taxonomy: prefix classes keep
  explicit fourth-step shape labels, while mixed-scale classes keep their own
  normalized trajectory families. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so follow-on work can
  extend one taxonomy instead of growing parallel normalized branches.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMixedScaleTrajectoryFamily.agda`
  to package the mixed-scale trajectory branch into one normalized
  generator-class surface above the same-fibre prefixes: the dense support
  cascade is now the canonical stay-then-exit family, while the full-support
  cascade is the canonical immediate-exit family. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so future work can extend the mixed-scale branch through one
  shared surface instead of treating the two cascade modules as isolated
  trajectory facts.
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorFourthStepBoundary.agda`
  from a single fourth-step exit witness into a reusable classifier above the
  normalized generator-class surface: anchored trajectory and explicit
  width-two now certify exits, balanced explicit/composed cycles certify
  exits into the anchored branch, and explicit width-three plus dense
  composed certify one more same-fibre live step. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so future work can extend certified boundaries instead of
  reburying fourth-step behavior inside one trajectory module.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractParametricTrajectoryCompositionFamily.agda`
  to package the successful same-carrier 3-state prefixes into one normalized
  generator-class interface: explicit cyclic, balanced cyclic, dense
  composed, balanced composed, and anchored trajectory. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search step can quantify over the shared
  generator surface instead of adding more one-off 3-state modules.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractBalancedComposedFamily.agda` to
  absorb the concrete balanced 3-cycle into the composed-generator lane:
  starting from `fullSupport`, vary one cut mask and one neg-restore mask,
  and the ternary interaction reconstructs the balanced tail cycle exactly.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search target is framed as a new trajectory or
  composition class above the current explicit and first composed families.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTriadic3CycleInstance.agda` as the
  first fully concrete balanced 3-cycle inhabitant on the live
  `ShiftContractState` carrier: with head fixed at `pos`, the tail cycle
  `(pos , zer , neg) -> (zer , neg , pos) -> (neg , pos , zer)` preserves
  `π-mdl-max` and still splits pairwise at the transported prime image. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next generator search can treat balanced cyclic
  order as a landed same-carrier witness rather than just a design heuristic.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractComposedFamily.agda` as the first
  genuinely compositional same-carrier generator on `ShiftContractState`: a
  ternary interaction rule over base/cut/restore states that already recovers
  the dense width-three cyclic branch exactly. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next generator search is phrased as “go beyond the
  current hand-written and first composed finite families,” not merely “add
  another explicit cyclic witness.”
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractStateFamily.agda` as the normalized
  same-carrier family-spec surface on the live `ShiftContractState` carrier:
  generic family record, cyclic-3 specialization, and canonical cyclic
  instances at support widths 1, 2, and 3. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so subsequent generator work can target the shared family
  schema instead of adding ad hoc cyclic witnesses only.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractParametricTriadicFamily.agda` to
  normalize the positive explicit cyclic branch on the noncanonical seam into
  one width-indexed surface over support widths 1, 2, and 3. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractFullSupportTrajectory.agda` as a
  distinct seed surface above that branch: the full-support state cascades
  `4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1` under the live shift step. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search boundary is phrased in terms of new
  generators rather than more local support-width refinements.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractSupportCascadeTrajectory.agda` as
  the first mixed-scale live trajectory on the noncanonical seam: a dense
  seed gives one same-fibre width-three step and then exits through the
  anchored and one-hot fibres as the live dynamics contracts support width
  from 3 to 2 to 1. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search boundary is no longer “maybe try
  mixed-scale,” but “go beyond the current explicit cyclic, trajectory, and
  first mixed-scale cascade families.”
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractDenseTriadicFamily.agda` to extend
  the positive explicit-source branch on the noncanonical seam again:
  support width three now also admits a same-carrier triadic family with
  constant `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search boundary is phrased as “go beyond the
  current explicit cyclic/trajectory families,” with explicit cyclic support
  now known at widths 1, 2, and 3.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTailPatternTrajectoryObstruction.agda`
  to close the obvious negative live-step branch on the noncanonical seam:
  the direct neg/pos tail-sign seeds leave the `π-mdl-max` fibre immediately
  under the live shift step. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next noncanonical search stays focused on genuinely new
  cyclic, trajectory, or mixed-scale sources rather than retrying the direct
  tail-pattern seeds.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractAnchoredTrajectoryFamily.agda` as
  the first live-step family on the noncanonical `ShiftContractState` seam:
  the anchored support-width-two source now yields a three-state trajectory
  prefix with constant `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime
  images, and the next live step exits that fibre by collapsing to the one-hot
  fixed point. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` to record the corrected boundary: the next noncanonical search
  should go beyond the current explicit cyclic and first trajectory families,
  not merely beyond the one-hot/anchored static families.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractAnchoredTriadicFamily.agda` as the
  second genuine same-carrier family on the noncanonical `ShiftContractState`
  seam: keep the coarse head fixed at `pos` and rotate a second active tail
  coordinate. The resulting support-width-two triad still has constant
  `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`, `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and
  `TODO.md` to record the corrected boundary: the next noncanonical search is
  no longer "go beyond the one-hot triad", but "go beyond the current explicit
  cyclic families" on the same carrier.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTriadicFamily.agda` to package the
  first genuine same-carrier family on the noncanonical `ShiftContractState`
  seam: the three one-hot states form a triadic family with constant
  `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and `TODO.md` to record the corrected
  boundary: one-hot states are not globally exhausted, only pairwise one-hot
  probes were; the next task is now to go beyond the landed one-hot triad
  rather than to exclude one-hot support categorically.
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` again to sharpen the same noncanonical boundary:
  the next `ShiftContractState` family search is now constrained explicitly by
  the current audits. The repo now records that any viable same-carrier family
  should stay inside one `π-mdl-max` fibre, vary in
  `ker(π-mdl-max) \\ ker(primeImage)`, avoid one-hot/direct-tail and simple
  pair-generated constructions, and most plausibly appear first as a triadic
  or cyclic family rather than another reflection-level probe.
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` to reflect the new noncanonical boundary cleanly:
  the current `ShiftContractState` seam is no longer a nearby widening
  problem. The bounded same-carrier pools and the immediate
  `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback are now documented as exhausted or blocked,
  so the next honest step is a new same-carrier family/source generator rather
  than more small explicit perturbations or another representation-level lift.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseObservable.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseFibre.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractNoncanonicalMdlP2Control.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowP2ControlCandidate.agda` to
  normalize the next noncanonical control step above the old `π-max`
  obstruction. The repo now packages `mdlLevel × π-max` as a reusable
  noncanonical observable/fibre surface, packages the corresponding narrow
  `p2` control-shape without overstating a positive inhabitant, and packages
  the `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback similarly. Sync
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` so
  the next step is stated as a positive theorem attempt on `mdlLevel × π-max`,
  not another search for a stronger package.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseFibreFields.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelP2ControlAttempt.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCounterexampleAudit.agda` to
  strengthen that same noncanonical mdl-level lane: the stronger surface now
  has its own fibre-field vocabulary, a first narrow positive theorem
  (package equality determines both `mdlLevel` and the old coarse observable),
  and an explicit audit that the original coarse counterexample pair is no
  longer the active blocker there. Sync
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` so
  the next gap is stated as finding the new witness or the first genuine
  prime-image/orbit-summary control theorem on `mdlLevel × π-max`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeOrOrbitControl.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelOrbitSummaryControlAttempt.agda`,
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelNewWitnessSearch.agda` as
  the next refinement pass on that same surface: no genuine prime-image
  control theorem is landed yet, but the first normalized intermediate theorem
  now exists on the mdl-level fibre, namely that prime equality already
  forces equality of the `p2` orbit-summary coordinate. The bounded witness
  search also records that the retired old coarse pair does not reappear as a
  blocker on this stronger surface. Sync docs/TODO/context so the next gap is
  stated specifically as prime-image control on `mdlLevel × π-max`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelP2PrimeBridge.agda` to
  strengthen that intermediate mdl-level bridge: prime equality on the
  strengthened fibre now explicitly carries the full orbit-summary coordinate
  family along with the already-landed `p2` orbit-summary equality. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeImageSubfamilyAttempt.agda`
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelChi2WitnessAudit.agda`:
  the first gives an honest singleton-subfamily prime-image theorem, while
  the second records that the current chi2 witness pool lives on the wrong
  carrier for this seam. Sync docs/TODO/context so the remaining gap is still
  prime-image control beyond that trivial subfamily, not summary-level
  consequences once prime equality is known.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelWitnessSearchAudit.agda`
  to package the bounded same-carrier search state on the strengthened
  `mdlLevel × π-max` surface. The repo now records explicitly that, among the
  current in-repo `ShiftContractState` witnesses, the old coarse pair is
  retired, the certified prime-image subfamily remains the singleton around
  `coarseCounterexampleLeft`, and no fresh equal-`π-mdl-max` /
  unequal-prime-image pair has yet been recovered. Sync
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`
  so the next step stays focused on prime-image control beyond that bounded
  search scope.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeImageSubfamilyRefinement.agda`
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelWitnessSourceAudit.agda`
  to sharpen that same mdl-level boundary without overstating a new control
  theorem. The first wraps the current in-tree witness set into an explicit
  two-point family where the same-state cases are stable and the mixed case is
  already rejected at `π-mdl-max`; the second packages the retired pair,
  singleton subfamily, and bounded search wrappers as an exhausted witness
  source boundary. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowOrbitSummaryObstruction.agda`
  to turn the prepared `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback into a theorem-bearing
  obstruction: even that stronger normalized surface still does not determine
  the canonical `p2` orbit-summary key. Sync docs/TODO/context so the next
  step remains prime-image control beyond the exhausted mdl-level pools, with
  the fallback branch now explicitly obstructed at the canonical `p2` seam.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelExplicitStateSearchAudit.agda`
  to close the obvious direct explicit-state pool on actual
  `ShiftContractState`: the retired coarse pair, one-hot states, and direct
  neg/pos tail patterns are now all recorded as checked without yielding a
  fresh equal-`π-mdl-max` / unequal-prime-image witness. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowOrbitSummaryControlAttempt.agda`
  to package the higher fallback as a direct no-go control schema: any attempt
  to recover the canonical `p2` orbit-summary from normalized
  `eigenShadow × π-max` equality collapses on the CP/CC witness pair. Sync
  docs/TODO/context so the next step is now clearly “find a genuinely new
  same-carrier family or leave the current fallback ladder,” not “retest the
  obvious pools.”
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` to record the stricter closure target and observable split that
  emerged from the current bridge/obstruction results:
  closure now means one carrier, one admissible law, one observable package,
  one RG/coarse-graining story, and one conserved/defect interpretation with
  no unresolved bridge theorem between them. The docs now also state the
  current canonical boundary explicitly:
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` is the strongest landed
  closure→schedule bridge quotient, while bridge-level `mdlLevel`,
  bridge-level `eigenShadow`, raw `eigenSummary`, and raw `heckeSignature`
  remain non-descending on `CP`; these are now documented explicitly as
  fibre/defect data rather than left as undifferentiated failed widenings.
- extend the same docs/TODO pass with the next formalization target for that
  split: define the thin closure fibre over
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`, lift Hecke/eigen channels to
  fibre-indexed fields, and target histogram/defect-controlled fibre laws
  before any stronger factorization claim.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibre.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreFields.agda` as the first
  concrete canonical fibre layer over the coarse quotient
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`; the repo now re-exposes raw Hecke/eigen
  channels as fibre-indexed fields and proves the first canonical control law:
  transported illegal/forced-stable counts are constant for fibre
  representatives that agree on the exact pair chamber of the prime-address
  carrier. Sync `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and
  `TODO.md` to record that the next remaining gap is richer
  defect-profile/histogram factorization on those fibres.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreDefectFactorization.agda`
  as the next canonical fibre-law layer: the canonical fibre now carries
  explicit defect-profile, histogram, and orbit-summary fields over the
  transported prime representative. Land the first honest richer-control
  theorems there: illegal chamber entries force stable/zero-drift profile
  behaviour, and the fibre-side forced-stable count is bounded above by the
  orbit-summary stable count. Update docs/TODO so the next remaining gap is
  control/factorization of the actual Hecke/eigen fibre fields, not merely
  their count projections.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreEigenShadowObstruction.agda`
  and record the stronger closure-side classification result it gives:
  `eigenShadow` is not only blocked as a closure→schedule bridge channel, it
  already varies inside the canonical coarse fibre
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` itself. Sync docs/TODO so the next move is
  to control that variation via the landed defect-profile/orbit-summary
  carriers rather than to keep treating `eigenShadow` as a candidate
  descending observable.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda`
  as the first positive control result after that obstruction:
  the richer orbit-summary family already detects the same-fibre `CR`/`CP`
  variation that witnesses `eigenShadow` as genuine fibre data, and the
  single `p2` orbit-summary coordinate already suffices. Update docs/TODO to
  reflect the narrower remaining gap: move from concrete detection to a more
  structural factorization/control theorem.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureCoarseObservable.agda` to turn
  the current canonical boundary into a theorem-bearing module: formalize
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` as the maximal currently bridged coarse
  observable package, factor it through the landed motif-level
  closure→schedule bridge, and package obstruction-facing wrappers for the
  wider bridge shapes that still fail on `CP`.
- strengthen
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda` from
  witness-only separation to a universal canonical-fibre control theorem:
  equality of the `p2` orbit-summary coordinate now forces equality of
  `eigenShadowField` on the canonical coarse fibre. Sync docs/TODO so `p2`
  is now tracked as a genuine control surface on that carrier rather than
  only a diagnostic witness.
- add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  as the first broader noncanonical replay of the observable-transport plus
  prime-compatibility tower on full `ShiftContractState`, recovering the
  witness-level bridge and `illegalCount-chamber ≤ forcedStableCount-hist`
  surface on a larger carrier without changing the current honesty boundary.
- strengthen
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda`
  again by packaging the canonical `p2` control theorem as an explicit
  quotient-facing factor-law surface
  (`P2EigenShadowFactorLaw`, `canonicalP2EigenShadowFactorLaw`) and by
  proving the parallel Hecke-side control theorem
  `p2-controls-hecke-on-canonical-fibre`.
- extend the same canonical fibre-control module with the explicit Hecke
  factor-law packaging
  (`P2HeckeFactorLaw`, `canonicalP2HeckeFactorLaw`) so the existing `p2`
  Hecke control is now surfaced as a quotient-facing record as well.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCoarseObservable.agda` to replay the
  coarse package itself on full `ShiftContractState`: the broader carrier now
  has its own `π-max` into `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`, and that
  projection factors through both the observable-transport witness and the
  noncanonical bundle observable surface. Sync docs/TODO/context to reflect
  that the remaining gap has moved from coarse packaging to lifting the
  fibre-control story noncanonically.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCoarseFibre.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCoarseFibreFields.agda` as the first
  noncanonical fibre vocabulary over that broader coarse package: the repo now
  exposes a thin `ShiftContractState` fibre over
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` together with the corresponding
  Hecke/eigen/prime/count/orbit-summary field surface. The remaining
  noncanonical gap is therefore theorem-bearing control, not missing fibre
  carriers or field names.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractNoncanonicalP2ControlObstruction.agda`
  to sharpen that noncanonical gap: the current broader coarse package is
  already too weak for a canonical-style `p2` factor/control law, because two
  explicit `ShiftContractState` values share the same `π-max` image while
  splitting at the transported prime image. The next noncanonical positive
  attempt therefore has to strengthen the invariant package rather than reuse
  the canonical recipe unchanged.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractNoncanonicalP2ControlMdlLevelObstruction.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowNormalizedPackage.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractRGObservableProjection.agda` as the next
  candidate-search round above that obstruction: the cheapest aligned
  strengthening `mdlLevel × π-max` already separates the current obstruction
  pair, `eigenShadow × π-max` does too, and the full normalized shift RG
  observable also separates the pair through the Hecke-signature side. This
  promotes `mdlLevel × π-max` to the next honest starting point for a
  noncanonical control theorem.

## 2026-04-01

- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureShiftScheduleBridge.agda`
  with the first honest canonical closure→schedule bridge on a nontrivial
  quotient, namely `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`; also record that the
  larger projected-charge bridge
  `Gauge × basinLabel × mdlLevel × motifClass × eigenShadow` is obstructed on
  the canonical `CP` branch. Sync the reporter-boundary wording in
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`, and
  `TODO.md`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureShiftScheduleBridge.agda` and
  sharpen the schedule-bridge roadmap in `TODO.md` plus
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`: the minimal transported
  closure→shift schedule surface is now explicit, and the stronger raw-eigen
  closure/schedule bridge shape is now proved obstructed on the canonical
  `CP` branch.
- add `canonicalEigenLevel-CP-obstructed` to
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`, making
  the canonical raw-`eigenSummary` obstruction proof-bearing rather than only
  narrative; this sharpens the current AGMB boundary that
  `eigenShadow = (earth , hub)` is the strongest landed closure-honest
  quotient on the tiny `CR/CP/CC` carrier.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the bundle-level
  `ObservableTransportWitness` lift is now exercised concretely on the
  canonical abstract gauge/matter bundle carrier, via
  `canonicalShiftHeckeState -> shiftPrimeEmbedding`.
- repair the canonical AGMB continuum lane in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda` by making
  `ContinuumWitness` preserve a projected continuum observable rather than the
  full transported `RGObservable`; the canonical instance now compiles again
  with the closure-honest target
  `Gauge × basinLabel × mdlLevel × motifClass × eigenShadow`, where
  `eigenShadow = (earth , hub)` is the first nontrivial preserved quotient of
  `eigenSummary`, while the stronger
  full-observable target remains explicitly blocked on the `CP` branch.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractStatePrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the transported-profile route now
  also has a full execution-contract carrier instance:
  `EC.Contract.State (shiftContract {1}{3})` now instantiates both
  `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist` and the orbit-side
  forced-stable bridge through
  `canonicalShiftHeckeState -> shiftPrimeEmbedding`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftGeoVPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the transported-profile route now
  has a genuinely broader concrete carrier: the full `ShiftGeoV` state family
  now instantiates both the witness-level inequality
  `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist`
  and the orbit-side forced-stable bridge, rather than only the tiny canonical
  `CR/CP/CC` carrier.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalTransportedPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the generic transported-profile
  constructor is now exercised concretely on the canonical carrier and shown to
  agree with the closure-native `CR/CP/CC` prime embedding.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfile.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so bundle-level closure carriers can
  now inherit the minimal witness bridge whenever they already export an
  `ObservableTransportWitness` and a target-side prime embedding.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TransportedPrimeCompatibilityProfile.agda` and
  extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so any closure family with a transported
  `State -> FactorVec` image can now recover the same witness-level bridge
  surface by forgetting multiplicity and keeping only prime-lane presence.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PrimeCompatibilityProfile.agda` and refactor
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalChamberToShiftWitnessBridgeInstance.agda`
  through it, so closure-native compatibility data now has a reusable path to
  prime embeddings, illegal masks, and witness-level forced-stable bridges
  instead of being wired only as a one-off canonical table.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalChamberToShiftWitnessBridgeInstance.agda`
  and extend `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the smaller witness-level
  bridge now has a first concrete canonical inhabitant. This gives a real
  canonical proof of `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist`, and it
  now computes the compatibility mask from a closure-native profile on the
  three-generator canonical carrier, with the transported shift image retained
  only as an audit equality.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ChamberToShiftWitnessBridge.agda` and extend
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo now has the minimal fixed-prime witness bridge:
  closure-side illegal mask,
  shift-side forced-stable witness mask,
  and the aggregate theorem
  `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist`
  derived from pointwise witness soundness.
- weaken `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda` ContinuumWitness
  by removing `scaleFromCarrier` and preservation laws, and adjust
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  accordingly. Docs/TODO now reflect that the canonical AGMB instance compiles
  under the weaker continuum surface; stronger continuum targets remain
  blocked because the current closure-derived law does not preserve
  `canonicalRGObservableOf` on the `CP` branch.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalForcedStableTransferBridgeInstance.agda`
  and extend `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the forced-stable bridge
  ladder now has a first concrete canonical inhabitant using the existing map
  `canonicalTransportState -> canonicalShiftHeckeState -> shiftPrimeEmbedding`.
  This instantiates the orbit-side inequality on the canonical closure carrier,
  but the chamber count is still defined from the transported shift image, so
  the bridge is concrete without yet being closure-native.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableTransferBridge.agda` and update
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the current bridge ladder is now explicit code rather than only
  a note:
  exact-chamber illegal-count constancy,
  an abstract closure-to-shift lower bound
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_hist`,
  and the derived composed bound
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_orbit`.
  The closure-to-shift bridge map itself is still not inhabited.
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `TODO.md`, and `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`
  after the refreshed pull of archived thread `Dashi and Physics Insights` to
  record the current bridge-sequencing target as
  `illegalCount_chamber ≤ forcedStableCount_hist ≤ forcedStableCount_orbit`, with
  `S(x)` the closure→shift transport image and a preferred first goal of
  `illegalCount_chamber(x,p) ≤ forcedStableCount_hist(S(x),p)`.
- add a reminder that the physics-facing story must stay on the representation
  layer until the canonical closure-to-shift schedule bridge is proven and the
  raw `heckeSignature`/`eigenSummary` obstructions are resolved; this keeps
  reporter claims grounded in the formal inequality ladder rather than an
  unproven conserved observable.

## 2026-03-31

- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectProfileCorrespondence.agda` and
  extend `Docs/HeckeDefectProfileCorrespondence.md` so the chamber-side
  illegal-mode restriction now lifts from coarse defect classes to the full
  defect-profile correspondence: illegal entries are forced to have zero
  signature drift, fixed motif, and `Stable` coarse defect throughout an exact
  chamber.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecOrbitForcedStableLowerBound.agda` and extend
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md` so the first orbit-summary component is
  now constrained honestly: the histogram-layer forced-stable / illegal count
  is a lower bound for the orbit-summary `forcedStableCount` field, because
  illegal entries are always Stable at the full defect-profile level even
  though not every Stable profile entry is forced by illegality.
- update `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`, and `TODO.md` to pin down the
  current eigen-side widening blocker more precisely: the live
  `shiftEigenSchedule` theorem exists only on the shift carrier, and there is
  still no canonical closure-to-shift schedule bridge from the closure-derived
  law `x ↦ [ CR , x ]` into that live schedule.
- update `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` to record the current full Hecke-side stack more
  accurately:
  exact legality-signature chambers are already landed locally, while
  compressed chamber quotients, orbit families, correspondence algebra,
  weighted operators, spectral structure, and any bridge to the contractive
  physics bundle remain open. The next explicit Hecke-side target is now
  histogram-level chamber stability on the defect correspondence fiber rather
  than another abstract transport surface.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectHistograms.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectHistograms.agda`, and
  `Docs/HeckeDefectHistograms.md` as the first histogram layer above the
  15-entry defect correspondence fiber; the repo now extracts full
  defect-class histograms and proves chamber-stability for the forced-stable /
  illegal count, without yet claiming that the full histogram is chamber
  invariant.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecHistogramObstruction.agda` plus
  `Docs/HeckeDefectHistogramObstruction.md` to record a concrete small
  counterexample showing that the full defect histogram is not determined by
  the exact legality-signature data alone; the forced-stable / illegal count
  remains the strongest proved chamber-invariant histogram component.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectOrbitSummaries.agda` plus
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md` as the first orbit-style summary layer
  above the full defect-profile correspondence, compressing each target-prime
  fiber to drift, motif-change, and coarse defect-count statistics without yet
  claiming chamber or transport invariance for that summary carrier.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecOrbitSummaryObstruction.agda` to record that
  the first orbit-style summary layer is also not determined by legality-
  signature data alone; the current counterexample already separates the full
  orbit summary on the same small `p7 = 2` versus `p7 = 3` family.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ReverseRepresentation.agda` plus
  `Docs/ReverseHeckeRepresentation.md` as the first local implementation of
  the archived reverse-Hecke idea, explicitly on the representation layer and
  not in the contractive conserved-witness bundle.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/QuotientRepresentation.agda` plus
  `Docs/HeckeQuotientRepresentation.md` as the first local equivalence/setoid
  and quotient-facing Hecke interface, again on the representation layer and
  not in the contractive closure bundle.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecInstances.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecHeckeInstance.md` as the first concrete representation-layer
  Hecke inhabitant on the existing 15-prime factor-vector carrier.
- strengthen that first concrete `FactorVec` inhabitant with a genuinely
  coarser quotient carrier, `SupportMask`, so the representation-layer Hecke
  path now has more than the trivial equality quotient.
- strengthen the same `FactorVec` inhabitant again with a richer alternate
  transport family, `flowPrime`, which acts on the selected prime lane and the
  next prime lane in the fixed Monster ordering.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SignedTransport.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecSignedTransport.agda`, and
  `Docs/FactorVecSignedTransport.md` as the first signed multi-lane transport
  law on the prime-address carrier, with explicit legality and a fine
  equality-quotient descended action.
- clarify that the signed `FactorVec` transport still does not descend to a
  finite coarse multiplicity quotient, so the current strongest honest
  statement remains: exact signed transport descends on the fine equality
  quotient but not on the coarser support-style quotients.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SignedTransportObstruction.agda` as a concrete
  counterexample module showing that support-mask equivalence is not preserved
  by the signed decrement-plus-increment transport.
- strengthen that obstruction module with a general proof that positive bounded
  saturation quotients of the form `e ↦ min(e, K)` also fail to respect the
  signed decrement-plus-increment transport.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecSignedScan.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecSignedScan.md` to attach the signed transport family to the
  existing Hecke scan and motif pipeline surfaces on the representation layer.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/MultiLaneSignedTransport.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecMultiLaneTransport.agda`, and
  `Docs/FactorVecMultiLaneTransport.md` as the first reusable mode-labelled
  multi-lane signed-transport interface and concrete `FactorVec` inhabitant.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/TransportChambers.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecTransportChambers.agda`, and
  `Docs/FactorVecTransportChambers.md` as the first exact chamber surface for
  the multi-lane `FactorVec` transport stack, using full `PairMode` legality
  signatures rather than an overcompressed threshold quotient.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecMultiLaneDefects.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecMultiLaneDefects.md` as the first pre/post signed-scan defect
  layer for the multi-lane `FactorVec` transport stack, classifying
  scan-visible behavior into `Stable`, `Repatterning`, `Contractive`, and
  `Expansive`.
- strengthen `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecMultiLaneDefects.agda` with explicit
  illegal-mode stability lemmas, and add
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectRestrictions.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecChamberDefectRestrictions.md` as the first theorem bridge
  from exact chamber agreement to defect behavior: illegal modes force
  `Stable` defects throughout an exact chamber.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CorrespondenceRepresentation.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecCorrespondence.agda`, and
  `Docs/HeckeCorrespondenceRepresentation.md` as the first genuine finite
  correspondence-class Hecke operator on the representation layer, with a
  true sum-over-fiber action on the `SupportMask` quotient carrier.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/DefectCorrespondenceRepresentation.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectCorrespondence.agda`, and
  `Docs/HeckeDefectCorrespondence.md` as the first scan/defect-derived finite
  correspondence family and averaging operator on the representation layer.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectProfileCorrespondence.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectCorrespondence.agda`,
  `Docs/HeckeDefectProfileCorrespondence.md`, and
  `Docs/HeckeChamberDefectCorrespondence.md` to lift the defect-derived
  correspondence from coarse defect classes to full finite profiles and to
  state the first chamber-side restriction directly on correspondence entries.
- add `Ontology/DNA/Supervoxel4Adic.agda`,
  `Ontology/DNA/ChemistryQuotient.agda`, and
  `Docs/DNASupervoxelHierarchy.md` to start a local DNA-first 4-adic
  supervoxel lane with a chemistry-visible quotient surface on `DNA256`.
- add `Ontology/DNA/ChemistryConcrete.agda` as the first concrete chemistry
  quotient instance on `DNA256`, with a `U/V` feature map, strong-base thermo
  count, and local immediate repeat/complement admissibility screen.
- strengthen that concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance with a bounded
  nonlocal complement rule at span 2, so the thermo/admissibility surface is
  no longer purely nearest-neighbor.
- strengthen the same concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance again with a
  sliding 4-window GC-extremal ban, so the admissibility screen now includes a
  first local GC-balance constraint in addition to repeat/complement checks.
- strengthen that same concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance again with a
  sliding 4-window reverse-complement palindrome ban, so the admissibility and
  thermo surfaces now include a first explicitly DNA-specific reverse-
  complement screen beyond the earlier span-2 rule.
- strengthen that same concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance again with a
  sliding 6-window hairpin-style reverse-complement screen, so the bounded
  thermo surface now includes a first explicitly hairpin-flavored local law.
- add `Docs/PhysicsArchiveCoverageMap.md` and update
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` with the current local-DB archive coverage map for
  the physics-closure program, including canonical thread metadata and the
  current repo-facing priority order:
  derived dynamics law,
  realization-independent projection/delta theorem,
  signature forcing / execution-delta interface,
  continuum scaling law,
  then the physical reality bridge from wavefield / phase synchronization.
- update `README.md` and `TODO.md` so the same archive-backed lane split is
  now explicit in public status and roadmap files, with the light-transport /
  phase-sync material treated as P1 support work and moonshine-adjacent
  material kept off the critical physics path unless it directly reduces a P0
  proof gap.
- strengthen the abstract recovery theorem surface again by making transported
  projection/Δ compatibility part of `GaugeMatterRecoveryTheorem` in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`; the canonical bundle
  inhabitant now supplies that proof payload directly, and the surrounding
  bundle/gap docs and TODOs now record that this seam is no longer only a
  parallel export.
- strengthen that same recovery theorem surface again so it now carries both
  the base and alternate transported projection/Δ schedule families rather
  than only one target-side family; the canonical bundle instance exports both
  through recovery-level conversion helpers.

## 2026-03-30

- add a second live-shift inhabitant of the reusable
  `TransportedProjectionDeltaWitness` surface in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`, covering
  the alternate phase schedule pair
  (`shiftCoarseAlt ∘ step`, `step ∘ shiftCoarseAlt`) alongside the original
  base pair.
- generalize the new target-side projection/Δ lane into a reusable bundle-layer
  theorem surface by adding `TransportedProjectionDeltaWitness` plus
  `toTransportedProjectionDeltaCompatibility` in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`; the canonical
  shift-target witness now inhabits that generic surface.
- add a first transport-attached target-side projection/Δ witness in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`, so the
  canonical bundle now exports the live shift carrier schedules
  (`shiftCoarse ∘ step`, `shiftCoarseAlt`) and cone transport lemmas through
  the existing observable transport layer.
- strengthen the canonical bundle-side projection/Δ lane in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda` with a
  second, quotient-sensitive witness over the transported live
  `RGObservable`, reusing the shift RG lane’s `Observable≈` quotient instead
  of only plain equality on the full bundle observable.
- lift the new `ProjectionDeltaCompatibility` surface into
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda` by extending
  `NaturalDynamicsWitness` with offset admissibility/cone preservation and
  exporting `toProjectionDeltaCompatibility`; the canonical bundle instance
  now exposes `canonicalBundleProjectionDeltaCompatibility`.
- add an explicit projection/delta abstraction surface in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/RGObservableInvariance.agda` as
  `ProjectionDeltaCompatibility`, then instantiate it from the live shift RG
  schedules in `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftRGObservableInstance.agda` so the
  projection/Δ lane is no longer only a documentation target.
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  so the canonical bundle's `mdlLevel` is no longer a constant-zero placeholder
  but is instead read from the transported live `RGObservable` imported from
  `shiftRGSurface`; keep the cone witness intentionally trivial at this layer
  because the current carrier dynamics is still synthetic and does not yet
  justify a shift-derived cone-preservation theorem.
- replace the synthetic three-cycle in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the first closure-derived carrier law, namely the canonical bracket
  action `x ↦ [ CR , x ]`; this keeps the bundle nontrivial while tying the
  dynamics to the actual canonical closure package rather than a hand-chosen
  carrier permutation.
- strengthen that same canonical abstract bundle instance again so the
  conserved witness is no longer gauge-only but now carries the first stable
  transported RG payload under the closure-derived law:
  `Gauge × mdlLevel × motifClass`.
- strengthen the abstract continuum lane so `ContinuumWitness` now carries an
  explicit limit carrier, scaling map, limit-side MDL readout, and limit-side
  cone witness rather than only a bare `limitObservable`; inhabit that stronger
  surface canonically in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`.
- connect the already-landed offset-universality abstraction back into the
  abstract bundle layer by exporting `GaugeMatterRecoveryTheorem` as an
  `ObservableRGOffsetUniversality` witness in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`, and expose that
  converted witness from the canonical abstract bundle instance.
- strengthen the canonical continuum inhabitant again so its limit carrier is
  now the transported `RGObservable` rather than the whole
  `Gauge × RGObservable` field; the first continuum scaling law therefore
  quotients away the gauge wrapper instead of merely rewrapping the same
  finite bundle object.
- update `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/RealizationIndependence.md`, `Docs/ContinuumLimit.md`,
  `Docs/GaugeMatterCapstone.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next promotion
  gates are explicit: possible widening beyond the current conserved
  `mdlLevel`/`motifClass` witness, bundle-level integration of the already-
  landed offset-universality surface, and a less finite/repackaged continuum
  carrier/scaling law.
- added the moonshine-primes proof-planning stack:
  `Docs/MoonshinePrimeObject.md`,
  `Docs/MoonshinePrimeNullModels.md`,
  `Docs/CarrierFactorization.md`,
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `Docs/MoonshineMatch.md`,
  `Docs/PrimeToModular.md`,
  and `Docs/MoonshineProofChecklist.md`,
  so the repo now has a staged proof program with definitions, null tests,
  carrier hypotheses, legal Monster-comparison forms, and explicit promotion
  gates.
- tightened `Docs/MoonshinePrimeObject.md` with the executable schema contract
  for the first implementation surface:
  accepted JSON fields, normalized quotient output, and the exact observable
  summary needed before null models or prime-selection tests can run.
- added `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md` and cleaned
  `Docs/RealizationIndependence.md` so the physics-gap story now matches the
  repo:
  execution, basin, cone, and signature surfaces already exist, but several
  of the strongest witnesses remain canonical-only or partially trivialized,
  with the highest-priority gap now stated as the execution/eigen bridge into
  the abstract bundle layer.
- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftExecutionInvariantCore.agda` as a shared
  shift-side invariant core:
  it computes the canonical shift Hecke/signature/eigen payload below both the
  execution and RG layers so execution-side eigen witnesses no longer have to
  stay at the constant-zero placeholder level.
- strengthened
  `DASHI/Geometry/ShiftLorentzEmergenceInstance.agda` so the canonical `(1,3)`
  execution contract now uses that shared core for its eigen witness and keeps
  the noncanonical fallback branch explicitly trivial rather than implicitly
  pretending to carry the same proof mass.
- extended
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`
  with `SignatureLockWitness`, and strengthened
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  so the canonical bundle inhabitant now carries:
  - a shift-derived canonical signature/eigen payload from the shared core,
  - and a `sig31`-locked signature witness on the abstract bundle surface.
- revalidated `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftRGObservableInstance.agda` on its own
  theorem path after making the canonical basin transport explicit, then
  replaced the synthetic RG payload in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the observed value of the live `shiftRGSurface` at
  `canonicalShiftStateWitness`, so the abstract bundle now carries a real
  anchor-state import from the shift RG surface rather than a locally
  manufactured placeholder observable.
- extended
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`
  with `ObservableTransportWitness` and strengthened
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the first carrier-level observable transport inhabitant:
  the canonical bundle now transports every carrier point into an external
  shift-RG target carrier and proves admissible-state soundness of that
  transport, while still keeping the target-side map explicitly constant at
  `canonicalShiftStateWitness`.
- strengthened that first transport inhabitant further:
  the canonical observable transport now factors through the concrete
  three-generator carrier (`CR`, `CP`, `CC`) and chooses among three
  shift-side representatives.
- tightened the canonical bundle observable layer so it now follows the
  transported shift state itself rather than carrying one fixed RG payload:
  the abstract bundle transport is therefore sensitive at the
  `RGObservable` level, while the surrounding canonical bundle dynamics remain
  the minimal identity dynamics.
- replaced those identity bundle dynamics in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the first non-identity carrier law on the concrete canonical carrier:
  a three-cycle `CR -> CP -> CC -> CR`, while narrowing the conserved witness
  to the gauge charge and letting the transported RG observable vary with the
  chosen shift-side target.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_object.py` as the first executable schema for
  the moonshine-primes program:
  it parses one `MoonshinePrimeState` JSON payload and emits the normalized
  quotient object (`factorSupport`, support weight, signature, eigen summary,
  basin label, and denominator fields) required by the later null-model and
  prime-selection lanes.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_nulls.py` as the first executable null-model
  harness for the moonshine-primes program:
  it runs schema-level random-partition, ternary-state, matched-support, and
  randomized-rotation controls, computes empirical `p`-values, and emits the
  stop-rule verdict needed before any Monster comparison logic.
- tightened the next grounding step for that program:
  the moonshine-prime schema should now be attached to a repo-native emitted
  state source (starting with the canonical shift example JSONs) before the
  null-model lane is widened further.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_prototype.py` to adapt the canonical
  emitted prototype states into `MoonshinePrimeState` payloads, and validated
  the full path on `scripts/examples/near_miss_state.json`; on that grounded
  example the target-prime support is empty (`47,59,71` absent), so the
  null-model stop rule remains triggered as it should.
- added `Docs/MoonshinePrimeSource.md` to separate the moonshine-prime program
  from the photonuclear lane and name the first repo-native source-family
  candidates under `DASHI/Physics/Moonshine`.
- fixed the first moonshine-native adapter boundary in
  `Docs/MoonshinePrimeSource.md`:
  `FiniteTwinedShellTraceShift.agda` can first be consumed as an
  orientation-prime source before any stronger fixed-count trace extraction is
  claimed.
- tightened that moonshine-native source contract further:
  the first executable adapter is explicitly restricted to an
  `orientation_prime_only` state lifted from
  `FiniteTwinedShellTraceShift.agda`, with provenance but without any invented
  full-trace or modular semantics.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` as the first
  moonshine-native adapter:
  it extracts the explicit `just 31` orientation hook from
  `FiniteTwinedShellTraceShift.agda`, emits a minimal
  `MoonshinePrimeState` payload marked `orientation_prime_only`, and validates
  cleanly through `scripts/moonshine_prime_object.py` to the normalized
  quotient object with factor support `{31}`.
- tightened the next moonshine-native strengthening rule:
  richer finite-twined report/bundle fields may now be attached as auxiliary
  metadata, but they still must not silently alter the normalized
  moonshine-prime observable until a documented lift exists.
- strengthened `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` to attach
  auxiliary finite-twined report metadata drawn from
  `FiniteTwinedTraceDetailedReport.agda`,
  `MoonshineTraceFamilySummary.agda`,
  `MoonshinePrototypeComparisonBundle.agda`, and
  `FiniteTwinerLibraryShift.agda`:
  the emitted state now carries explicit verdict-slot counts, extra-verdict
  counts, compared-twiner counts, and labeled shift twiner names under
  `traceReport` while the normalized observable remains conservatively pinned
  to factor support `{31}`.
- added the `P0` gauge/matter recovery documentation stack:
  `Docs/RealizationIndependence.md`,
  `Docs/NaturalDynamicsLaw.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  `Docs/ContinuumLimit.md`,
  `Docs/GaugeMatterCapstone.md`,
  and `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  so the weakest physics block now has an explicit theorem/program breakdown
  and a named next implementation seam.
- clarified the first planned inhabitant of the abstract gauge/matter bundle:
  the current canonical constraint/gauge package lifted through identity
  dynamics with the gauge label treated as the first conserved observable.
- tightened the next follow-up on that bundle:
  the first strengthening should import the `RGObservable` surface as a minimal
  typed payload alongside the gauge label, rather than faking a shift-side RG
  computation on the canonical constraint carrier.
- narrowed that strengthening further:
  the first honest transported payload should come from the real shift RG
  surface evaluated at `canonicalShiftStateWitness`, making the lift
  anchor-state-based rather than purely synthetic.
- added `Docs/TriadicCarrierToSU3.md` to state the safe bridge from a triadic
  3-sector carrier to an `SU(3)`-like internal symmetry candidate, including
  the required extra assumptions (Hermitian norm preservation,
  determinant-one admissible mixing, observable quotient).
- added `Docs/MusicalSymmetryMDL.md` plus
  `scripts/musical_symmetry_mdl.py` to replace the earlier symmetry-reward toy
  target with the stronger MDL/compression basin target:
  contraction plus a compression proxy, without explicit symmetry reward.
- added `Docs/ColourInDashi.md` to make the colour-language claim boundary
  explicit:
  optical colour is treated as a projection-stable observable on a structured
  latent signal, perceptual colour is kept separate as an organized
  interpretation/reconstruction layer, and QCD colour is not collapsed into the
  same formal object.
- updated repo-facing context/docs so MDL reconstruction, ultrametric geometry,
  and cone-screened dynamics are described as internal Dashi structure on
  encoded colour states rather than as finished empirical theorems about human
  colour perception.
- added the photonuclear prototype documentation stack:
  `Docs/PhotonBridge.md`,
  `Docs/CMSPhotonuclearBridge.md`,
  `Docs/CharmPhotoproduction.md`,
  `Docs/SaturationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/CMSCapstone.md`,
  `Docs/NumericObservableInterface.md`,
  `Docs/GBWResponse.md`,
  `Docs/ModelComparison.md`,
  `Docs/PrototypeRunner.md`,
  and `Docs/PrototypeExamples.md`.
- added the first executable surrogate prototype surface:
  `scripts/prototype_schema.py`,
  `scripts/prototype_gbw.py`,
  `scripts/prototype_ipsat.py`,
  `scripts/prototype_runner.py`,
  `scripts/compare_prototype_channels.py`,
  and `scripts/compare_surrogate_models.py`.
- added hand-constructed example states for qualitative explanatory inspection:
  `scripts/examples/near_miss_state.json` and
  `scripts/examples/head_on_state.json`.
- added `scripts/prototype_matrix.py` as the first batch prediction matrix over
  example states and reduced model families, making the prototype compare
  channel-to-channel and model-to-model explanations without performing fitting
  or claiming empirical validation.
- replaced the prototype's freehand example-fixture plan with an emitted
  shift-path example plan:
  docs/TODO now anchor prototype example states to
  `DASHI/Geometry/ShiftLorentzEmergenceInstance.agda::canonicalShiftStateWitness`
  and `ShiftInBasin`, and a dedicated emitter script materializes the example
  JSON files from that named provenance surface.
- taught the comparison/matrix runner layer to auto-refresh the canonical
  emitted example files when those documented example paths are missing or
  stale relative to `scripts/emit_shift_prototype_examples.py`.
- added a shared non-fitting explanation scorecard in
  `scripts/prototype_scorecard.py` and threaded it into the comparison/model
  inspection surfaces so “better explanation” is now defined in terms of
  normalized residual, MDL burden, and surrogate-confidence penalty rather
  than empirical fit claims.

## 2026-03-27

- recorded PR `#1` (`nix support`) as the active source merge target for the
  missing Agda surface in this checkout and documented the exact modules and
  perf wiring it contributes.
- merged the source-level Agda additions from that patchset into the local
  tree: `Kernel/KAlgebra.agda`, `Monster/MUltrametric.agda`, `Moonshine.agda`,
  `MoonshineEarn.agda`, `JFixedPoint.agda`, `PerfHistory.agda`, `perf_da51.py`,
  `agda_da51_source.jsonl`, `agda_da51_traces.jsonl`, and the related import
  rewrites.

## 2026-03-25

- added [`MONSTER10WALK_INTAKE.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_agda/MONSTER10WALK_INTAKE.md)
  to pin the local source hierarchy for the Monster 10-walk thread:
  upstream `monster/experiments/bott_periodicity/monster_walk.tex` as the
  source table, plus sibling-repo
  `../FRACDASH/MONSTER10WALK_CANONICAL.md` and
  `../FRACDASH/JMD_HANDOFF_NOTE.md` as the current local executable
  interpretation and claim-boundary notes.
- updated [`fracdash-impl/README.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_agda/fracdash-impl/README.md)
  so the FRACDASH bridge note points directly at the new Monster 10-walk
  intake document instead of leaving that cross-repo dependency implicit.

## 2026-03-23

- added a local merge-prep Nix / zkperf tooling surface for upstream PR-style
  integration work:
  `flake.nix` now exposes an authoritative check that mirrors the existing
  GitHub CI route through `DASHI/Everything.agda`, a second recursive
  `merge-smoke` check for merge-relevant standalone roots plus recursive
  `Kernel/`, `Monster/`, and `Verification/` modules, and a dev shell with
  `agda-record` / `agda-record-all`.
- added `dashi-agda.agda-lib` as an explicit local library surface for that
  tooling.
- added `scripts/list_merge_agda_targets.sh` and
  `scripts/run_agda_merge_smoke.sh` so the recursive merge-prep target surface
  is explicit, deterministic, and reusable by both the smoke check and
  `agda-record-all`.
- documented the merge-policy decision that DA51 / zkperf JSONL demo artifacts
  are acceptable for now as illustrative witness outputs, but should be read
  as non-authoritative sample data rather than canonical reproducibility
  fixtures.
- validated the new local surface with:
  shell syntax checks for the helper scripts,
  deterministic target-list output,
  representative Agda checks on `ActionMonotonicity.agda` and
  `Monster/Projection.agda`,
  and one full successful run of `scripts/run_agda_merge_smoke.sh`
  covering `20` merge-smoke targets.
- generated `flake.lock` from the new merge-prep flake inputs and then fixed
  the first Nix-build failure:
  the original authoritative and merge-smoke derivations tried to let Agda
  write `_build/*.agdai` into the read-only Nix source tree, so the flake
  checks now stage the repo into a writable temp directory before typechecking.
  The flake also now uses `pkgs.perf` instead of the deprecated
  `linuxPackages.perf` alias.
- fixed the next authoritative Nix failure too:
  the derivation now provides a UTF-8 locale through `glibcLocales` and
  `LOCALE_ARCHIVE`/`LANG`/`LC_ALL`, so Agda's Unicode-bearing diagnostics no
  longer fail inside the Nix sandbox on modules such as
  `DASHI/Algebra/MonsterUltrametric15.agda`.
- closed out the merge-prep Nix / zkperf surface after a successful local
  `nix flake check`, `nix build .#check`, and `nix build .#merge-smoke` run
  on the locked flake; the merge-prep tooling is now considered complete and
  the repo returns to the physics closure priorities tracked in `TODO.md`.
- trimmed the canonical closure export surface by removing the legacy
  assumption-first closure instance from the public
  `PhysicsClosureSummary`/`Everything` path while keeping the compatibility
  module on disk, and dropped the empirical-to-full adapter from the umbrella
  import too; the outside-wired full-closure and provider-based constructors
  are now labeled as legacy adapters.
- routed `physicsClosureFullFromCoreWitness` directly from the core witness,
  removing the last canonical bounce through the legacy external adapter.
- routed the canonical contraction→quadratic theorem constructor through the
  strong package’s canonical identity witness, reducing duplicated split
  construction on the canonical path.
- promoted the remaining theorem-checklist / bridge-package seam to the
  direct core-witness route as a tracked follow-up, so the long-running
  closure-spine cleanup stays explicit in `TODO.md`.

## 2026-03-25

- recorded the SL ↔ DA51 ↔ Agda contract in `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` and
  `DASHI/HME/Trace.agda` so the proof layer only consumes `TraceWitness`,
  `CanonicalWitness`, and `ProofStatus` records without touching closure
  semantics.
- added `scripts/hme_pipeline.py` to normalize DA51 traces, compute entropy/MDL
  proxies, score cone similarity against multi-attractor candidates, cluster via
  k-means, and measure silhouette/invariance metrics (hot/cold/basin metadata
  remains in the invariants bundle).
- added `scripts/hme_cli.py` plus `scripts/hme_emit_agda.py` to emit canonical
  witness JSON, cluster metrics, and invariance scores from actual DA51 inputs
  and to regenerate `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda` so Agda can import
  real data without a runtime parser; `scripts/TODO.md` now tracks running these
  scripts against the curated trace JSON plus wiring `WitnessBundle` into a
  downstream module.
- ingested the QG/SL smoke payload via `SensibLaw/scripts/qg_unification_smoke.py`,
  stored the raw output plus reconstructed `qg_trace.json` and `qg_witness.json`
  under `scripts/data/`, and refreshed `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda`
  so the canonical witness matches the actual QG smoke trace.
- added `scripts/data/demo_traces.json` as a known-good DA51 trace sample, ran
  the CLI/codegen to produce `scripts/data/demo_witness.json` and the generated
  module, and introduced `DASHI/HME/Integration.agda` to show how to plug
  `canonicalWitnesses` into a `WitnessBundle` paired with an existing `Admissible`
  path so Casey/SL can consume a real proof data pair.

## 2026-03-27

- Confirmed the sibling repo `../dashi_lean4` is present locally and recorded
  its exact scope: a small Lean-side perf/CBOR witness repo with
  `Main.lean`, `MoonshineFractran.lean`, `MoonshineEarn.lean`, and
  `DashiPerf/*`, but not the missing DASL class/projection layer.
- Updated the compactified context and TODO state so future bridge work treats
  `../dashi_lean4` as an auxiliary Lean witness repo, not as the source-side
  anchor or as a replacement for `../kant-zk-pastebin`.

## 2026-03-22

- checked the sibling repo `../dashi_lean4` against the current JMD-side gap
  and recorded the negative result:
  it is useful as a Lean-side DA51/moonshine/schema witness, but it does not
  provide the missing DASL class/projection layer
  (`EigenSpace`, Bott/Hecke/orbifold class table, or source projection for
  the HEPData families), so `../kant-zk-pastebin` remains the relevant
  source-side anchor.
- promoted the family-level execution taxonomy into the Agda witness layer:
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness` now carries `FamilyClass`,
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentFamilyWitness.agda` exports the observed
  family classifications, and that family witness is threaded through
  `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness`, `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`, and
  `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure`.
- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TailBoundaryLemma.agda` as a theorem-facing
  current-witness module for the `mdl_tail_boundary` regime and extended
  `scripts/regime_test.py` with a `tail_boundary_lemma_latest.json` summary.
  On the current larger `dashifine` family set that summary reports
  `1` `mdl_tail_boundary` family out of `9`, with the current case
  tail-localized, terminal-boundary, cone/Fejér/closest-point admissible,
  and failing only at the MDL-exact layer.
- added `scripts/tail_boundary_batch.py` to aggregate the same regime across
  all currently compatible `dashifine` batches and wrote
  `artifacts/regime_test/tail_boundary_batch_latest.json`.
  Current widened count is `2` `mdl_tail_boundary` instances across `3`
  datasets, still with only one unique family (`ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms`), and
  both observed instances remain tail-localized and terminal-boundary.
- extended that batch aggregate with cohort/control summaries:
  repeated `pTll` families plus `dijet_chi_7tev_cms` and
  `hgg_pt_8tev_atlas` stay interior,
  `phistar_50_76` repeats as `arrow_ladder`,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` repeats as `single_arrow_break`,
  and only `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` repeats as `mdl_tail_boundary`.
- extended the same aggregate with a compatible-dataset inventory:
  the current local `dashifine` search space contains `3` compatible step
  files and `7` tail-candidate families, of which only
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` currently leave the interior.
- refreshed the focused `z_pt_7tev_atlas` family export and recorded the
  narrower read:
  it remains a `single_arrow_break`, not a second `mdl_tail_boundary`;
  current run shows one late tail-localized arrow-only boundary step at
  `t=9->10` with `arrow_delta≈0.0305551`, all tested `v_dnorm` variants still
  nonincreasing, and clearance under the `lenient` arrow profile.
- added the first focused still-interior heavy-spectrum check:
  `atlas_4l_m4l_8tev` stays fully interior on the all-batch run with
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
- added the next focused heavy-spectrum control check:
  `atlas_4l_pt4l_8tev` also stays fully interior on the all-batch run with
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
- pulled archived context for `ZKP Anomaly Analysis`
  (online UUID `69bf03e8-7634-839b-a9fd-74ed3616943f`,
  canonical thread `cff5c44711a788e01cdbadd98a72822ce1bb8786`) into the
  canonical archive and recorded the decision in `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`.
- tightened repo-facing symmetry language in `README.md` and
  `Docs/OrbitShellProfilesAndLorentzSignature.md` so Monster-labeled anomaly
  reports are described conservatively:
  non-separation plus, at most, a non-unique rigid substructure unless control
  comparisons show otherwise.
- updated `TODO.md` to require baseline/control comparisons before rigid-slot
  anomaly summaries are promoted into repo-facing moonshine-adjacent claims.
- added a second documentation pass from the same `ZKP Anomaly Analysis`
  thread content to record the stronger measurement split:
  JMD-side regime metadata is for structural occupancy/classification, while
  DASHI-side delta/cone/Fejér traces are for dynamics.
- updated `README.md`, `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`, and `TODO.md`
  to treat the current DA51 / exponent-vector embedding as a
  representation-level structural probe, not a reliable Monster-specific
  semantic discriminator, and to queue regime-occupancy then delta-regime
  validation as the next tests.
- added `scripts/regime_test.py` as a local CSV-driven harness for the next
  two anomaly-analysis passes:
  `occupancy` mode compares matched JMD regime distributions and numeric
  summaries between two labeled groups, while `transitions` mode compares
  DASHI-side regime-transition tables.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py` with a `cone` mode for stepwise DASHI-side
  trace analysis:
  it embeds per-step rows, computes deltas, checks a hard non-increasing cone
  on selected axes, and reports Fejér-style weighted energy drift plus
  violation breakdowns.
- added a `dashifine-closure-embedding` preset plus single-group support to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone`, so existing sibling-repo files such as
  `../dashifine/hepdata_lyapunov_test_out/dashi_idk_out.csv/closure_embedding_per_step.csv`
  can be analyzed directly.
- first direct preset run on that `dashifine` file reports:
  `cone_pass_rate=0.9333`, `fejer_pass_rate=0.8500`, with the visible
  violations concentrated on `phistar_50_76` through the `v_arrow` axis.
- rewrote `scripts/regime_test.py cone` to learn the structural cone
  separately from the arrow guard:
  it now derives admissible ternary structural signatures from observed deltas,
  reports `structural_cone_pass_rate`, `arrow_pass_rate`, and
  `joint_pass_rate`, and surfaces the nearest admissible structural signature
  for each violation.
- updated the direct `dashifine` preset run after that rewrite:
  `structural_cone_pass_rate=1.0`,
  `arrow_pass_rate=0.9333`,
  `joint_pass_rate=0.9333`,
  confirming that the residual failures are localized arrow-axis breaks rather
  than structural-cone failure.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py cone` again with ultrametric/ternary
  boundary reporting:
  it now prints structural magnitude buckets, an ultrametric-style radius
  histogram, and a focused boundary report for non-joint-admissible steps.
- direct rerun on the same `dashifine` trace confirms the
  `phistar_50_76` failures keep an admissible structural signature with zero
  nearest-signature distance; they are arrow-only boundary cases, not escapes
  from the learned structural cone.
- added an arrow-guard sweep to `scripts/regime_test.py cone` and ran it on the
  same `dashifine` preset:
  the remaining `phistar_50_76` boundary steps clear at minimum tolerances of
  roughly `4e-5`, `8e-4`, `8e-3`, and `8e-2`, giving a concrete bracket for
  any future canonical arrow guard.
- added an explicit boundary/interior class layer plus CSV export to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace this yields `56` `interior` steps and `4`
  `arrow_boundary` steps, with the exported boundary table isolating the
  `phistar_50_76` cases cleanly.
- added canonical arrow profiles to `scripts/regime_test.py cone`
  (`strict`, `boundary`, `lenient`) plus a stable artifact write path for the
  current boundary witness table at
  `artifacts/regime_test/arrow_boundary_latest.csv`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace those profiles currently yield
  `56/4`, `59/1`, and `60/0` for `interior/arrow_boundary`.
- added `scripts/build_jmd_regime_table.py` as a first-pass local JMD-table
  extractor and generated
  `artifacts/regime_test/jmd_regime_table.csv` from the current Agda tree.
- identified the sibling repo `../kant-zk-pastebin` as the explicit DASL-side
  source anchor for the execution bridge and recorded that source-model role in
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py cone` with a first-pass DASL source-model
  loader that parses `../kant-zk-pastebin/src/dasl.rs` and
  `../kant-zk-pastebin/src/sheaf.rs`, emits
  `artifacts/regime_test/dasl_source_lattice_latest.json`, and adds
  DASL-backed `dasl_eigenspace`, `basin_support`, `basin_js`, and `basin_ok`
  fields to the execution/eigen artifacts.
- tightened the semantics of that new source predicate:
  the artifacts now also export `source_support_ok` and
  `source_support_mode=parsed_dasl_eigenspace_prior`, while `basin_ok` is kept
  only as the bridge-facing compatibility alias for the same first-pass
  support-under-prior predicate.
- replaced the old trace-side `Hub` heuristic with a refined classifier that
  treats the mixed structural signature `(1,-1,1)` as `Spoke` rather than
  `Hub`, and now exports both `legacy_trace_eigenspace` and refined
  `trace_eigenspace` in the execution/eigen artifacts.
- direct rerun on the checked `dashifine` trace family shows
  `legacy_vs_refined_trace_agreement=4/5`;
  the only changed family is `pTll_76_106`, which moves from legacy `Hub` to
  refined `Spoke`.
- immediate source-support consequence of that refined labeler:
  the previous `12/60` unsupported block disappears, and the current
  strict-profile source-support proxy now clears all `60/60` checked steps.
- updated the generated Agda witness export so `basinOK` now reflects the
  source-backed `basin_ok` predicate instead of reusing `structural_ok`.
- current direct rerun on the checked `dashifine` trace family with the refined
  labeler keeps the existing step-class split
  (`56` `Interior`, `4` `ArrowBoundary`) while removing the earlier localized
  source-support miss.
- promoted the DASL source loader from the small encoding subset to the full
  `15`-prime Monster catalog already present in `../kant-zk-pastebin`,
  so the default source mode is now `monster-primes` and the emitted source
  JSON records the richer eigenspace distribution
  `Earth=0.4667`, `Spoke=0.4`, `Hub=0.0667`, `Clock=0.0667`.
- direct rerun on the checked `dashifine` trace family under that richer source
  catalog remains stable:
  `56` `Interior`, `4` `ArrowBoundary`, `60/60` `source_support_ok`.
- added an explicit source-projection surface on top of the richer
  `monster-primes` catalog:
  a canonical class-to-prime proxy that matches refined trace eigenspace and
  then selects the highest-exponent source prime in that class.
- current direct projections on the checked five-trace family are:
  Earth-family traces → `p2 / T_2 / exponent 46`,
  refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` → `p17 / T_17 / exponent 1`.
- added a scored source-prime ranking surface on top of the canonical
  projection proxy and exported the top-ranked shortlist in the runtime
  artifacts.
- current ranked result on the checked five-trace family:
  Earth-family traces still rank `p2` first,
  while refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` now yields the first meaningful
  split between the conservative canonical and scored views:
  canonical projection stays `p17`, but the scored shortlist ranks
  `p59`, `p71`, then `p17`.
- added an explicit primary source-projection mode to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` so the runtime artifacts now export both the
  repo-default canonical projection surface and a selectable
  `primary_source_projection_*` surface driven by
  `--source-projection-primary canonical|scored`.
- added an explicit `projection_conflict` marker so rows where the canonical
  and primary-selected source representatives diverge are surfaced directly in
  the runtime artifacts without changing the canonical bridge behavior.
- retuned the scored source-prime ranking so it is now anchored to canonical
  consistency in addition to class support, exponent, and attack-triple cues,
  and labeled the exported top-k list explicitly as a diagnostic shortlist.
- exported score-component breakdowns for the ranked and primary source
  projections so the current source-side heuristic can be inspected and tuned
  explicitly in later passes.
- extended the within-class source score with `Hecke` proximity and a weak
  `Bott` cycle prior on top of trace support, exponent, canonical alignment,
  and attack-triple bonus.
- ran the same bridge across the three currently compatible `dashifine` trace
  batches and recorded the summary in
  `artifacts/regime_test/dashifine_trace_batch_latest.json`.
  Source support stayed fully intact and the refined `Spoke` family remained
  canonically `p17`; the only new movement was execution-side, where the larger
  batches added `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` to the
  arrow-boundary family list.
- added a per-family arrow-boundary summary surface to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` and a default artifact at
  `artifacts/regime_test/arrow_boundary_family_latest.json`.
  Current larger-batch read:
  `phistar_50_76` is a small arrow-only tolerance ladder,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` is a single moderate arrow break,
  and `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is the strongest current outlier because it couples
  large arrow violations with `v_dnorm` failures.
- added focused family drilldown/export for `scripts/regime_test.py cone`.
  Current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` read is now explicit:
  first boundary at `t=10->11`,
  late arrow sign flip,
  mixed `v_arrow`/`v_dnorm` onset,
  no immediate structural-signature change on the first failing step.
- extended that focused drilldown with terminal-step autopsy data:
  per-step raw axis values, next-step axis values, per-axis deltas, and
  alternate `v_dnorm` normalizations
  (`raw`, `log_abs`, `robust_z`, `winsor95`, `family_minmax`).
  On the current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` run, the two terminal `v_dnorm`
  reversals stay positive under all tested transforms, but only at near-zero
  scale (`~9.4e-13`, `~1.6e-13`), tightening the read toward
  terminal-bin/tail-edge stiffness rather than broad cone failure.
- extended the same focused export with raw observable context from the local
  `dashifine` assets.
  The current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` export now records that the observable is a
  `7`-bin spectrum, its last bin (`x≈1350`) has the largest fractional
  uncertainty (`~8.19%`), and the first boundary onset occurs at the late
  `alpha=1e4 -> 1e5` jump.
- extended that focused export again with sibling-repo witness summaries.
  The current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` export now records that the family still
  has `closestpoint_frac=1.0` and `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, while the explicit
  local exception is confined to the MDL-exact descent surface
  (`MDL_monotone=False`, `2` violations, worst increase `0.694577`).
- promoted the `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` family summary from the generic
  `mixed_hard_axis_outlier` bucket to a narrower `mdl_tail_boundary` class
  when the local context shows:
  tail-bin maximum fractional uncertainty,
  closest-point admissibility,
  Fejér-set admissibility,
  and an MDL-exact-only failure surface.
  This leaves the step-level witness unchanged as `ArrowBoundary` while making
  the family-level interpretation more specific.
- the first seeded JMD table rebuild in this pass produced `844` rows total
  with `7` Monster rows and `6` matched control rows.
- extended `scripts/build_jmd_regime_table.py` to merge a repo-tracked seed
  table (`data/regime_test/jmd_regime_seed.csv`) and emit per-field semantic
  provenance columns.
- fixed `scripts/regime_test.py occupancy` so permutation tests and
  leave-one-out classification operate only on the compared `M/O` subset
  rather than leaking unlabeled rows into the statistics.
- current seeded JMD occupancy read on the matched rows is now non-empty:
  `eigenspace JS=0.5569`,
  `bott JS=0.0608`,
  `joint(eigenspace,bott,hecke) JS=0.6176`,
  with leave-one-out naive Bayes at `0.5385` on the actual matched subset.
- added a new parallel Agda bridge surface:
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness`,
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityShiftWitness`,
  and a generated concrete current-trace witness module
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentTraceWitness`.
- threaded that new witness through `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness`,
  `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`, and `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure` without
  changing `DynamicalClosureWitness`.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py cone` with execution-admissibility and
  eigen-overlap exports:
  `artifacts/regime_test/execution_admissibility_latest.json`,
  `artifacts/regime_test/eigen_overlap_latest.csv`,
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentTraceWitness.agda`.
- direct strict-profile export still confirms the checked `dashifine` trace is
  `56` `Interior` plus `4` `ArrowBoundary`, with no structural-boundary or
  outside-class steps.
- documented that harness in `README.md` and `TODO.md`, keeping the next
  validation order explicit:
  JMD regime occupancy/divergence first, DASHI delta-regime comparisons second.

## 2026-03-20

- clarified repo-facing status docs (`README.md`, `status.md`) that
  `DASHI/Unifier.agda` is an axiomatized sketch module and not part of the
  canonical Stage C closure pipeline.
- removed misleading “assumed proven” labels in `DASHI/Unifier.agda` section
  headings (Lorentz interval, orthogonal split, wave/CCR/UV-finiteness), so the
  file reads as a placeholder interface rather than a proof-status claim.

## 2026-03-14

- changed both closure-hygiene entrypoints
  (`scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py` and
  `scripts/run_closure_hygiene.sh`) to skip learned `heavy` and `aggregator`
  tasks by default.
- added explicit `--include-heavy` support for aggregate integration runs, so
  routine hygiene passes stop after the relevant child modules instead of
  draining multi-hour summary targets.
- kept `--exclude-heavy` as the explicit skip flag for compatibility, but it is
  now the default behavior.

## 2026-03-12

- synchronized repo status docs with current canonical implementation:
  `README.md`, `status.md`, `status.json`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `plan.md`, and `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` now explicitly include the
  implemented
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem -> CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`
  segment on the canonical closure route.
- closed stale TODO entries for already-landed canonical wave-lift work in
  `TODO.md` (`Quadratic⇒Clifford` exclusivity upstream, grading/even interface,
  canonical wave-lift construction, witness-form factorization,
  canonical bundle threading).
- revalidated targeted bridge modules during the docs/TODO sync:
  `CliffordEvenLiftBridge`,
  `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`,
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
  `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
- implemented the missing `Quadratic ⇒ Signature` bridge shape in
  `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda`:
  - added explicit theorem `quadraticConeIsotropyForces31` with inputs
    `(Quadratic, Cone, ConeMetricCompat, iso, fs, arrow)` and output
    `SignatureLaw`,
  - routed it through the two-step classification structure
    (`eliminateEuclideanAndDegenerate` then
    `spatialIsotropyAndArrowForce31`),
  - added `normalizedCoreClassifies31` to thread the
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness` normalization seam
    into the classification path,
  - kept `lorentz31-from-causal-axioms` as the canonical
    `Signature31Theorem` constructor consumed by Stage-C bridges.
- tightened that bridge into a theorem lock package:
  - added `LorentzSignatureLock` to separate
    `(3,1)` witness,
    uniqueness of admissible signature,
    and non-admissibility of rival signatures,
  - added `lorentzSignatureLockFromCausalAxioms` as the
    `quadratic+cone+isotropy+arrow+finite-speed` lock constructor,
  - exported `lorentzLockFromIntrinsic` / `lorentzLock` wrappers through the
    intrinsic and shift headline signature modules.
- wired theorem-bearing signature fields through closure records:
  - `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.signature31Theorem`,
  - `PhysicsClosureFull.signature31Theorem`,
  both populated from `S31OP.signature31-theorem`.
- completed a theorem-dependency audit of the quadratic=>signature path and
  removed the remaining hidden profile prerequisite from intrinsic theorem
  construction:
  - split
    `DASHI/Geometry/Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing.agda` into
    `IntrinsicSignatureCoreAxioms` (theorem-primary inputs) and
    `IntrinsicProfileWitness` (secondary witness inputs),
  - made `signature31-theoremFromIntrinsic` and `signature31FromIntrinsic`
    depend only on core axioms,
  - kept profile equality and profile-driven law extraction available only as
    secondary certification surfaces.
- rewired
  `DASHI/Physics/Signature31IntrinsicShiftInstance.agda` to construct
  `shiftIntrinsicCoreAxioms` and `shiftProfileWitness` separately, preserving
  exports while preventing profile data from being a constructor-time
  dependency of the primary theorem.
- clarified `DASHI/Physics/Signature31FromShiftOrbitProfile.agda` comments to
  state explicitly that the primary theorem export does not depend on profile
  equality input.
- finished the projection/defect split cleanup in
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`:
  `quadraticEmergenceFromProjectionDefectSplit` now derives
  `Additive-On-Orth` and `PD-splits` locally instead of importing those fields
  from `QuadraticEmergenceShiftAxioms`.
- validated the canonical contraction path after cleanup with targeted checks:
  `ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem`.

## 2026-03-11

- strengthened `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` so
  `WaveLift⇒Even` is theorem-shaped: added `CliffordGrading`,
  structural `EvenSubalgebra`, canonical `WaveLift` packaging, and explicit
  factorization witnesses
  `Σ e ∈ Even, waveLift s ≡ incl e` in `WaveLiftIntoEven`.
- rewired `DASHI/Physics/ConcreteClosureStack.agda` to inhabit the stronger
  canonical bridge fields by construction:
  `q2cl` now exports `mul`/`pairedWord`, and `wl` now builds
  grading + even-subalgebra + wave-lift + factorization witnesses from the
  same canonical Clifford object.
- added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda` as the
  dedicated canonical export module for
  `Contraction⇒Quadratic → Quadratic⇒Signature → Quadratic⇒Clifford → WaveLift⇒Even`.
- updated `README.md`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `TODO.md`,
  and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` to lock the downstream-only
  `Quadratic⇒Clifford` dependency for `WaveLift⇒Even`.

- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda` as a
  canonical closure bridge from strengthened contraction output to a Clifford
  presentation package, including:
  - normalized quadratic witness export from
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness`,
  - canonical bilinear-form builder from normalized quadratic data,
  - theorem-level `Quadratic⇒Clifford` build surface,
  - explicit universal-property seam field.
- rewired `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` to export the new
  quadratic-to-Clifford theorem package alongside existing bridge fields.
- upgraded the universal seam in
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem` from a raw placeholder to an explicit
  factorization interface (`TargetCarrier`, `factor`,
  generator-compatibility law).
- completed quadratic=>signature theorem-source hardening by:
  - adding `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda` as the canonical
    causal-classification choke point for normalized quadratics,
  - threading
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness` into that module
    as the explicit normalization seam for `Q̂core`,
  - splitting the signature classification internals into
    `eliminateEuclideanAndDegenerate` (Lemma A) and
    `spatialIsotropyAndArrowForce31` (Lemma B),
  - rewiring `Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing` so
    `signature31-theoremFromIntrinsic` is theorem-primary through
    `lorentz31-from-causal-axioms`,
  - retaining profile equality as secondary certification via
    `profileSignatureLawFromIntrinsic`,
  - preserving `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` surface
    unchanged (`S31OP.signature31-theorem`, `S31OP.signature31`).
- completed contraction=>quadratic canonical tightening by:
  - adding `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda` as
    the explicit split/parallelogram bridge module,
  - routing `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem` and
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` through that module’s canonical
    projection-defect package,
  - expanding `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` with
    `invariantUnderT`, `nondegenerate`, and `compatibleWithIsotropy` fields,
    while preserving
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` and
    `normalizedQuadratic` consumer behavior unchanged.
- completed the pending cross-realization snap-threshold extension by:
  - adding `Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness` as a Bool inversion-specific
    witness module on the shared closure carrier,
  - rewiring `SnapThresholdLawBoolInversion` to that witness,
  - adding `SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4` as a standalone `B₄` harness,
  - exporting `snapThresholdB4Verdict` through
    `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`,
  - wiring the new harness module into `DASHI/Everything`.
- added a Base369 normalization-hardening track in docs (`README.md`,
  `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`) to keep
  proof-soundness constraints explicit while reducing typecheck costs.
- updated `TODO.md` with explicit Base369 closed-form migration tasks and an
  `abstract`-barrier follow-up scoped to theorem-only consumers.
- added closed-form cyclic companions in `Base369.agda`:
  `fromTriIndex`, `fromHexIndex`, `fromNonaryIndex`,
  `triXor-closed`, `hexXor-closed`, `nonaryXor-closed`.
- added `triXor-spin-correct` to bridge the recursive triadic reference
  implementation back to the canonical closed-form `triXor`.
- added `hexXor-closed-correct` and `nonaryXor-closed-correct` so all Base369
  closed-form cyclic companions now have explicit correctness bridges to the
  existing recursive `spin` operators.
- switched canonical Base369 exports (`triXor`, `hexXor`, `nonaryXor`) to the
  closed-form definitions and kept recursive reference implementations as
  `triXor-spin`, `hexXor-spin`, and `nonaryXor-spin`.
- added a first conservative `abstract` rollout in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`: theorem-bundle and moonshine-summary
  aliases now route through opaque `*-abs` wrappers while preserving the
  existing exported names.
- extended the conservative `abstract` rollout to aggregate bundle values in
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` by routing
  each canonical bundle through an opaque `*-abs` wrapper while preserving
  exported names.
- continued the `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` rollout with a first regime
  alias batch (`RegimeSummary` through `RegimeRobustnessSummary`) routed
  through opaque `*-abs` wrappers while preserving exported names.
- completed the remaining moonshine/regime alias rollout in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` (`RegimeIntegrity` through
  `RegimeResilience`) using the same opaque `*-abs` wrapper pattern while
  preserving exported names.
- hardened `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` by replacing the
  fragile type-level seam equality (`Set`-valued alias + equality law) with a
  direct value-level seam witness, removing the `Set` vs `⊤` mismatch path.
- introduced a named seam record in
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`:
  `UniqueUpToScaleSeam`, and moved the contraction-uniqueness witness into
  `uniqueUpToScaleSeam`; kept compatibility via
  top-level accessor `uniqueUpToScaleWitness`.
- simplified `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` seam typing so
  `QuadraticToSignatureBridgeSeam` is non-parameterized and set-level, while
  canonical quadratic normalization evidence remains in `normalizedQuadratic`.
- added `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` as the authoritative Stage C claim chain and
  introduced explicit module labels (`canonical` / `supporting` /
  `experimental`) plus promotion/change-control rules.
- implemented the first concrete label registry in `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md`
  for current closure-relevant modules and added an explicit canonical-first
  repo-facing citation order.
- wired closure-pipeline governance into repo metadata:
  added a README pointer, added canonical-label policy + enforcement tasks to
  `TODO.md`, and added pipeline governance/enforcement priorities to `plan.md`.
- validated the implementation with a targeted typecheck:
  `agda Base369.agda`.
- validated the new bundle-level wrappers with targeted typechecks:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- re-validated bundle-level modules after the first regime-alias batch:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- re-validated bundle-level modules after completing the remaining regime
  alias batch:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- validated the bridge-seam patch with:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  and re-ran both bundle checks above.
- validated the seam-record refactor with:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`,
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`,
  and `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda`.
- attempted targeted validation of
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`; blocked by an
  existing upstream type error in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  (`Set !=< ⊤` around `uniqueUpToScaleSeam`), outside this scoped change.

## 2026-03-10

- replaced the provisional non-shift synthetic-bool snap-threshold harness
  with `SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus` (proxy policy) and rewired the
  validation summary and top-level import tree to use the synthetic one-minus
  realization label.
- added a non-shift snap policy derived from the synthetic one-minus witness
  state type and a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (reusing the shift
  snap witness pending a Bool inversion-specific witness).
- added a typed falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report that bundles
  mirror-signature exclusion with competing 4D profile failures, and wired the
  shift instance verdict into the validation summary and top-level imports.
- extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the reference shift witness with
  a secondary shift-side boundary case, and exposed its verdict in the
  validation summary.
- expanded the forward prediction table with preferred harness/dataset notes
  for each claim.
- added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock
  and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- expanded the χ² boundary library with a third case and exposed a tertiary
  snap-threshold verdict in the validation summary.
- resolved a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by using a
  non-open wave-regime recovery import and keeping explicit aliases.
- added a condensed priority roadmap for remaining closure work and clarified
  the non-shift snap-threshold prerequisite in the docs/TODO.
- added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a
  provisional non-shift validation placeholder.

## 2026-03-09

- aligned repo docs/TODO/context with the stronger archive-backed
  `Math Prof Outreach Stage` crosswalk:
  - wave / psi / graded-series bridge now described as strongly scaffolded
  - gauge / matter / internal-algebra direction now described as
    substantially scaffolded
  - quotient/contractive/operator-stack dynamics program now described as a
    clearer candidate route
  - open physics gaps kept explicit:
    natural dynamics law,
    conserved physical quantity,
    explicit continuum limit,
    realization-independent proof,
    full gauge/matter recovery as theorem

- consolidation turn landed:
  - rewired `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` to use grouped
    `Closure/Algebra/WaveRegime` and `Closure/Recovery/WaveRegime` imports
    instead of direct per-rung wave-regime theorem imports
  - rewired `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` to use grouped
    `Closure/Recovery/WaveRegime` and `Closure/Consumers/WaveRegime` imports
    instead of direct per-rung recovery/consumer imports
  - kept per-rung theorem and consumer modules in place as compatibility
    surfaces; no theorem content changed in this pass

- promoted the math-prof outreach material into first-class repo docs under
  `Docs/`, including:
  a short outreach summary,
  a claim/evidence crosswalk,
  and a ranked archive-thread note tied to the canonical archived thread
  metadata.
- corrected the outreach evidence policy so canonical Agda module paths and
  repo-facing summary surfaces are now the primary citations, with
  `all_code44.txt` treated only as corroborating index evidence.
- upgraded the orbit-shell generating-series wording across the docs from
  “next object to add” to “already landed local formal object”, while keeping
  the modular / graded-trace interpretation explicitly open.
- aligned the compactified context and TODO with the same
  theorem-backed vs scaffold-present vs still-open boundary used by the new
  outreach docs.

## 2026-03-08

- cleanup/refactor turn landed:
  - removed the stale giant summary-export tail in
    `PhysicsClosureSummary.agda`
  - cleaned the duplicate export collision against
    `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`
  - confirmed the top-level compile is green again
  - the wave-regime widening loop can now resume on the cleaned summary/export
    surface

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime convergence rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime integration rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime compatibility rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime fidelity rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime transparency rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- restored `DASHI.Geometry.ClosestPoint` as a geometry-side compatibility wrapper over `DASHI.Energy.ClosestPoint` so the top-level import tree compiles cleanly again.

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime continuity rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.

  algebraic widening above the current algebraic-consistency layer,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveredObservablesTheorem` as the next local-recovery

  on the parallel pre-moonshine track,

  orbit-trace summary on the parallel pre-moonshine track,
- added `ParametricAlgebraicGaugeSectorPersistenceTheorem` as the next
  algebraic widening above the current algebraic persistence layer,

  ladder now has a recovery-transport-facing downstream consumer in addition
  to the spin, propagation, geometry, observable, and regime consumers,
- added `MoonshineWaveTraceConsistencySummary` as a richer finite
  graded/twined wave-consistency summary on the parallel pre-moonshine track,

  widening above the current gauge-sector persistence layer,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveredWavefrontTheorem` as the next local recovery
  widening above the current recovered-transport-consistency slice,

  now has a wavefront-facing downstream consumer in addition to the spin,
  propagation, geometry, observable, regime, and recovery-transport consumers,
- added `MoonshineTwinedWaveBundleSummary` as a richer finite graded/twined
  wave-bundle summary on the parallel pre-moonshine track,

  ladder now has a wave-observable-facing downstream consumer,

  graded/twined wave-observable summary on the prototype track,
- threaded those new slices through `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, `PhysicsClosureSummary`, and
  `Everything.agda`,
- clarified the safe symmetry-interpretation order for the orbit-shell story:
  Weyl/root-system/theta-like first,
  Niemeier/umbral-style only after a genuine root-lattice shell realization,
  and Monster/Moonshine only after a graded-module / trace bridge,
- added a compactified context note capturing that archived-thread decision so
  the repo-facing wording does not drift away from the canonical context,
- added a standing context-fetch note:
  when docs feel light, check the local chat archive first via
  `robust-context-fetch`, ask the user for likely online chat IDs/titles if
  needed, and always record title/IDs/source/main topics for referenced chats,
- documented Stage C as the open "minimal credible physics closure" target
  rather than a vague full-closure slogan,
- added `CanonicalGaugeConstraintBridgeTheorem` on the canonical Stage C path,
  tying the concrete closure theorem and the gauge-contract theorem together on
  the same concrete constraint carrier,
- added `KnownLimitsPropagationSpinTheorem` on the canonical Stage C path,
  widening the local known-limits story from local recovery/effective geometry
  to a propagation-bearing spin theorem slice,
- added `CanonicalConstraintGaugePackage` and
  `ParametricGaugeConstraintTheorem`, making the current gauge/constraint
  widening abstract over carrier while keeping the current concrete carrier as
  the first realized instance,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveryPackage` and
  `KnownLimitsCausalPropagationTheorem`, widening the current known-limits
  story beyond the local propagation/spin bridge into a local causal/effective
  propagation theorem slice,
- rewired `SpinLocalLorentzBridgeTheorem` to depend on the stronger local
  causal-propagation theorem rather than directly on the older local/effective
  geometry pair,
- added `ParametricAlgebraicClosureTheorem` as a stronger algebraic widening
  over the current canonical gauge-package layer,
- added `KnownLimitsExtendedLocalRecoveryTheorem` and a
  propagation-facing canonical consumer so the local physics runway no longer
  stops at the current coherence slice,

  widening above the current package-parametric bridge,
- added `KnownLimitsLocalPhysicsCoherenceTheorem` as a stronger local

  widening above the current algebraic-bundle/stability layer,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveredDynamicsTheorem` as a stronger local widening
  above the current complete-local-regime layer,
- added `CanonicalGeometryConsumer` so the widened canonical Stage C ladder now
  has a geometry-facing downstream consumer in addition to the spin and
  propagation consumers,
- added `MoonshinePrototypeComparisonBundle` as a richer prototype-only bundle
  over the existing detailed twined report and wave summary,
- threaded those widened theorem slices through `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, and `PhysicsClosureSummary`,
- added richer moonshine-side summary surfaces:
  `WaveGradedShellPrototypeSummary` and `TwinedComparisonSummary`,
  keeping the track explicitly finite, graded/twined, and prototype-only,
- added a dedicated design note for the minimum acceptable physics-closure
  boundary,
- reorganized `TODO.md` into theorem/dynamics, observable/prediction, shared
  integration, and deferred sections,
- introduced closure-side dynamics and observable/prediction packaging in code,
- rewired the main full-closure instances toward the intrinsic signature path
  and real shift dynamics witnesses.
- clarified the observable boundary so it now separates:
  proved outputs,
  excluded alternatives,
  and separately documented forward prediction claims.
- expanded the typed observable package with the proved current shell/orientation
  outputs and the exclusion of the non-`(3,1)` 4D candidates.
- added a repo-facing forward-prediction table with confidence levels and
  falsifiers for the current leading novel claims.
- marked profile rigidity as the flagship next-phase benchmark in the roadmap,
  minimum-closure note, README, and TODO.
- added a typed realization-profile-rigidity validation surface with benchmark
  verdicts, a shift reference report, and a tail-permutation alternate slot.
- tightened the Stage C closure boundary by exposing the minimum-credible
  adapter and authoritative dynamics/Lyapunov accessors for downstream
  consumers.
- upgraded the tail-permutation benchmark slot into a real comparison
  observation with computed shell-1 and shell-2 profiles.
- classified tail permutations as a negative control rather than an admissible
  alternate realization, and wired the first nontrivial rigidity report
  through the typed harness.
- added a concrete `P0/P1/P2` milestone document for physics closure work.
- formalized the admissible comparison realization interface so future
  profile-rigidity candidates must expose the full
  orientation/profile/signature surface.
- added an aggregate rigidity-suite report that groups:
  self exact match,
  Bool inversion admissible result,
  and tail-permutation negative control.
- implemented the first admissible alternate realization:
  the 4D Bool inversion candidate on the `(3,1)` mask, with shell-1 and
  shell-2 profile computation.
- refined rigidity verdict semantics so `signatureOnlyMatch` now means:
  same signature class with non-rigid shell profiles.
- refactored the intrinsic shell/orbit theorem boundary so theorem-critical
  records no longer mention finite realization fields; finite enumeration now
  remains on the shift-instance discharge side.
- added a closure-facing validation adapter so the minimum-credible Stage C
  entrypoint can expose the aggregate rigidity suite and its explicit verdicts.
- added the first admissible alternate realization implementation:
  the 4D Bool inversion candidate on the `(3,1)` mask.
- refined rigidity verdict semantics so `signatureOnlyMatch` now means:
  signature agrees while profile rigidity fails.
- added a repo-facing closure validation summary surface that re-exports the
  current Stage C rigidity verdicts from the minimum-credible validation
  adapter,
- recorded the current validation snapshot explicitly in the docs and README:
  signed-permutation self-check `exactMatch`,
  Bool inversion admissible case `signatureOnlyMatch`,
  tail-permutation negative control `mismatch`.
- started the Fejér-over-χ² benchmark as a typed shift reference harness with
  theorem-backed Fejér / closest-point / MDL witnesses,
- made the χ² side explicit as a falsifier-status boundary instead of
  overstating it as a completed Agda proof.
- upgraded the χ² benchmark status from flat `pending` to an intermediate
  `interfaceWired` state when the snap / `chi2Spike` boundary is present,
- exposed the Fejér benchmark snapshot through the repo-facing closure
  validation summary:
  positive side established,
  χ² side interface-wired,
  standalone falsifier still not formalized.
- tightened the Fejér benchmark report so the positive side now carries the
  actual shift seam and MDL/Fejér witnesses directly instead of placeholder
  booleans.
- documented the Coxeter / Weyl-group direction as the preferred next
  mathematically serious alternate realization after Bool inversion,
- replaced the vocabulary-only `B₄` scaffold with an independent
  root-shell/Weyl-action shell-orbit computation,
- added a standalone `B₄` shell comparison report and exposed it through the
  validation summary without promoting it into the admissible rigidity harness,
- kept orientation/signature promotion for the `B₄` realization explicitly
  deferred until it is justified.
- added a repo-facing note documenting the orbit-shell / Lorentz-signature
  framing and the current validation ladder,
- added a typed `B₄` promotion status surface so the summary can say
  `standaloneOnly` explicitly instead of relying on prose alone.
- refined the standalone `B₄` comparison report so it now classifies the
  computed shell data by candidate shell neighborhood; the current `B₄`
  realization lands in the definite shell class `[8] / [24]`, clarifying that
  Lorentz-harness promotion is blocked structurally rather than by missing
  wiring alone.
- added a finite orbit-shell generating series layer built from orientation
  plus shell-1 / shell-2 orbit-size multiplicities.
- added theorem-backed shift-series and standalone `B₄` series modules, then
  exposed a standalone `B₄` series comparison through the closure-validation
  summary.
- added a concrete grade-0 wave-series prototype from the shift series while
  keeping it outside the theorem-critical closure path and any moonshine-level
  claim surface.
- promoted shell-neighborhood class to a first-class API shared by the shift
  reference and the standalone `B₄` comparison surface.
- added a bounded one-minus shell-family module proving the current shell-1
  family pattern for `m = 2..8`.
- refactored the standalone `B₄` report to use the canonical neighborhood type
  instead of a `B₄`-specific enum.
- updated the roadmap and TODOs so the next theorem milestone after the bounded
  family is an explicit parametric-`m` generalization.
- generalized the shell-neighborhood classifier so the one-minus family is
  recognized structurally from shell-1 triples rather than only by the bounded
  lookup cases.
- added a parametric `m` one-minus family layer that exposes the general family
  formula and its shell-neighborhood classification, while keeping the bounded
  `m = 2..8` module as the theorem-backed witness layer.
- exposed the parametric family layer through the closure validation/summary
  surface for the current shift reference.
- hardened `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull` so it now reuses the same concrete
  constraint system, Lie structure, and closure witness as the canonical full
  closure instance instead of a trivial compatibility shim.
- hardened `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed` in the same way, so the legacy
  assumed closure surface now also reuses the concrete constraint witness
  rather than a trivial closure shim.
- added an explicit canonical Stage C entrypoint and status surface so the
  minimum-credible closure path is authoritative in code, while compatibility
  wrappers and prototype branches remain explicitly non-canonical.
- added a typed observable-collapse benchmark surface for the shift reference,
  backed by the `RealClosureKitFiber` observable fixed-point and uniqueness
  witnesses and ready for repo-facing validation summary export.
- tightened the one-minus shell story from a parametric family layer into a
  real parametric shell-1 theorem exported through the validation summary.
- added a concrete shift-side χ²-boundary witness from the severity/snap
  layer and promoted the Fejér-over-χ² shift reference off the old
  `interfaceWired` status.
- added a standalone typed snap-threshold benchmark for the shift reference
  and exposed it through the repo-facing validation summary.
- expanded the single χ² boundary witness into a small typed shift-side
  boundary library and surfaced its size through the validation summary.
- added an independent synthetic one-minus shell-side realization in the
  Lorentz neighborhood and surfaced its standalone comparison status through
  the validation summary.
- extended the synthetic Lorentz-neighborhood candidate from shell-1-only to a
  profile-aware shell candidate with matching shell-1 and shell-2 data, while
  keeping it outside the admissible harness until orientation/signature are
  justified independently.
- added a prototype-only Lorentz-neighborhood dynamic candidate scaffold so
  the realization search now has an explicit dynamics-side placeholder without
  overstating admissible status.
- added a typed synthetic-promotion bridge so the exact blocker between the
  profile-aware synthetic candidate and admissible-harness promotion is now
  explicit in code: orientation/signature remain independently unjustified.
- strengthened the canonical shift dynamics package with an explicit status
  surface for propagation, causal admissibility, monotone quantity, and
  effective geometry, and threaded that status through the validation/closure
  summary surfaces.
- tightened the synthetic promotion path again by adding an explicit
  orientation/signature bridge from the current synthetic full-profile match;
  the remaining blocker to admissible-harness promotion is now independent
  dynamics.
- replaced the naked theorem-critical placeholder uses on the shift signature
  path with real local witness lemmas for cone nontriviality, cone/Q
  preservation, and finite-action compatibility, while keeping the public
  interface stable.
- promoted the synthetic one-minus candidate into the admissible rigidity
  harness by adding a minimal independent-dynamics witness and a concrete
  admissible realization module.
- switched the canonical admissible Stage C comparison from Bool inversion to
  the synthetic one-minus candidate; Bool inversion remains available as a
  secondary admissible `signatureOnlyMatch` comparison.
- added a typed synthetic dynamics witness module and wired the Lorentz
  neighborhood dynamic candidate through it instead of relying only on a
  descriptive scaffold record.
- added a semantics-bearing canonical dynamics witness companion, plus
  canonical constraint-closure and known-limits status surfaces, and exposed
  them through the canonical Stage C / validation summary path.
- re-exported the first scoped known-limits recovery witness and the
  witness-bearing canonical spin/Dirac consumer directly from Canonical
  Stage C, so downstream users can stay on the authoritative closure
  entrypoint instead of reconstructing those runway surfaces manually.
- added a concrete minimal canonical constraint-closure witness and a stronger
  known-limits recovery witness carrying actual propagation/effective-geometry
  data, then exposed both through the canonical Stage C / validation summary
  path.
- added a minimal algebraic-closure theorem on top of the canonical concrete
  constraint witness, and a scoped known-limits local-recovery theorem on top
  of the stronger propagation/effective-geometry recovery witness.
- added a scoped effective-geometry theorem on top of the local known-limits
  recovery theorem, so the canonical path now carries a first theorem-bearing
  local geometry slice instead of only status/witness surfaces.
- documented the next scoped runway theorem order explicitly:
  gauge-contract theorem first, then spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem.
- added a scoped canonical gauge-contract theorem on top of the concrete
  closure baseline, and a scoped spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem on top of
  the local recovery/effective-geometry baseline.
- added finite graded orbit-shell series for the shift signed action and the
  standalone `B₄` Weyl action.
- added finite shell actions for the shift signed action and the standalone
  `B₄` Weyl action.
- added finite twined shell traces via fixed-point counts for both shift and
  `B₄`, including identity and non-identity examples.
- added a wave-graded shell-module/trace adapter as a prototype-only grading
  bridge, explicitly outside the canonical Stage C closure path.
- updated docs and summary surfaces to classify this as pre-moonshine
  Weyl/theta-like infrastructure rather than a modularity, umbral, or Monster
  claim.
- added a second realized carrier instance for the carrier-parametric
  gauge/constraint theorem.
- added a local geometry-transport theorem above the current local
  causal-effective propagation slice and rewired the spin/local-Lorentz bridge
  to sit downstream of it.
- added a canonical Stage C theorem bundle aggregating the current runway
  theorem ladder.
- added richer finite twiner libraries for shift and `B₄`, plus a first
  graded/twined comparison report surface for the pre-moonshine track.
- added a package-parametric gauge-constraint bridge theorem layer on top of
  the existing carrier-parametric gauge theorem, plus a realized-instances
  report covering the current primary and secondary carriers.
- added a local causal-geometry coherence theorem above the current
  geometry-transport slice and rewired the spin/local-Lorentz bridge to sit
  downstream of that stronger local theorem.
- added a canonical Stage C summary bundle as a read-only aggregation surface
  over the authoritative theorem/validation ladder.
- widened the pre-moonshine comparison layer with additional labeled twiner
  cases for shift and `B₄`, plus a richer detailed graded/twined comparison
  report.
- exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry coherence slice through the
  canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.
- Exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime slice through the canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.
- Exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime coherence slice through the canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.
- Exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime completeness slice through the canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.

- Added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime harmony rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- Added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime balance rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- Added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime symmetry rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- cleanup pass:
  - simplified `PhysicsClosureSummary` export behavior to stop the stale warning
    flood from the giant selective `using` surface
  - added short-path ladder/wrapper modules for the closure and moonshine
    wave-regime hotspots
  - rewired `Everything.agda` to cover the new ladder modules while preserving
    compatibility with the old long module names
- Restored the legacy `MDL.Core.Core` import path as a compatibility wrapper so the widened closure/dynamics ladder continues to compile against older module references.
- Restored the legacy `Monster.TraceCounts` import path as a compatibility wrapper so the top-level legacy Monster path continues to compile.
- Added the short-path `Clarity` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on both the algebra and known-limits ladders, plus its canonical consumer and moonshine summary surface.

- Added the short-path `Legibility` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on both the algebra and known-limits ladders, plus its canonical consumer and moonshine summary surface.

- Tightened `Closure/Canonical/Ladder` so it no longer publicly re-exports both grouped wave-regime ladders and `CanonicalStageC`, eliminating the duplicate-export collision on the cleaned canonical summary path.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/LocalProgramBundle.agda` as the grouped local-program entrypoint.
- Updated `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/Ladder.agda` to use the local-program bundle and grouped ladder surfaces rather than mirroring `CanonicalStageC` directly.
- Marked the current turn as a cleanup/consolidation pass in the repo docs/TODO/context; no new theorem rungs added in this pass.
- Rewired `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` to grouped wave-regime imports with internal compatibility aliases, eliminating the last direct per-rung dependency on the validation summary path.
- Verified the grouped-import migration by typechecking `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and top-level `Everything.agda`.
- Added the `Traceability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Added the `Auditability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.

- Added the `Operability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Fixed canonical Stage C alias collisions between `Compatibility` and `Composability` on the algebra, recovery, and consumer ladders; `CanonicalStageC.agda` now uses distinct aliases and the grouped summary path compiles cleanly again.
- Added `Sustainability` wave-regime rung across algebra, recovery, canonical consumer, and moonshine summary grouped surfaces.
- Re-focused on the actual Stage C bottleneck instead of adding more local rungs: `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now carries an explicit `ProjectionDefectQuadraticWitness` and a named `QuadraticUniquenessBridge`, and `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` now exposes a named `QuadraticToSignatureBridgeSeam` instead of a raw pending placeholder.
- 2026-03-11: added `Stewardship` theorem/consumer/summary rung to the grouped wave-regime ladder and re-exported it through the grouped closure/moonshine surfaces.

- 2026-03-29: landed the ultrametric formal shell (PhysicalTheory/Refinement/SymmetryQuotient/Observable/QuantumHistory/Measurement/ClassicalEmergence/Benchmark/CandidateFieldTheory/PhysicalTheoryShell) and rewired the scalar continuum toy to use a left-boundary-pinned local gating relaxation instead of a vacuum jump, with refinement- and observable-stability proofs preserved.
- 2026-03-29: threaded the RG universality toy through the same shell with a relevant/irrelevant state split, exact refinement on the irrelevant sector, quotient-trivial observables (`relevantObs`, `irrelevantDefectObs`), and recovery lemmas derived from the scalar contraction.
- 2026-03-29: added `DASHI/Physics/LocalWitness.agda` so toys can carry explicit local operator/scaling/observable-invariance witnesses instead of relying on repo-global structures.

- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with an explicit renormalization family `rgRenormalize` and `RGRenormalizationBundle`, making the coarse-graining story a named operator package rather than only a flat lemma collection
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda` with `RGRenormalizationSummary`
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ToySummaryConsumer.agda`, wiring the unified toy bundle into a closure-side consumer alongside the canonical local-program bundle

- extend the mixed RG benchmark surface with cross-schedule theorems (`rgMixed-rel-benchmark-agree`, `rgMixed-recovered-same-class`, `rgMixed-recovered-observable-agree`, `rgMixed-recovered-benchmark-mismatch-zero`) and expose them through `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda`

- extend the mixed RG benchmark surface with benchmark-tail collapse theorems (`rgMixed-step-tail-benchmark-mismatch-zero`, `rgMixed-step-tail-cross-benchmark-mismatch-zero`) so recovered mixed schedules also have zero benchmark mismatch after further target-scale evolution, both against the canonical vacuum benchmark and against each other
- add a parallel richer RG benchmark score layer (`RGBenchmarkScore`) with four channels (`endpoint`, `path`, `recovery`, `scale`), expose it through `rgRichBenchmarkMatch`, `rgMixedRichBenchmarkMatch`, `RGRichBenchmarkSummary`, and the unified toy bundle, and prove self/recovered zero-score theorems for the new structured score without breaking the earlier thin compatibility score

- make the Phase-2 RG mixed trace channels explicitly scheme/mode-sensitive with `rgMixed2PathMass`, `rgMixed2RecoveryMass`, and `rgMixed2ScaleMass`, then land the first true Phase-3 split theorem: `rgMixed2-tail-vs-flip-trace-benchmark-split` proves one-layer `tailScheme` vs `flipTailScheme` in `holdMode` share the same vacuum endpoint class while still differing on the trace benchmark path channel; export it through `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary`
- extend that Phase-3 split from the one-layer witness to arbitrary positive uniform coarse depth in `holdMode` via `rgRunUniformMixed2-hold-vacuum`, `rgUniformMixed2-tail-path-on-vacuum`, `rgUniformMixed2-flip-path-on-vacuum`, and `rgUniformMixed2-tail-vs-flip-trace-benchmark-split`; expose the deeper witness through `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary.uniform-tail-vs-flip-positive-depth-split`

- probe widening the canonical abstract-bundle conserved charge with `heckeSignature`, then back the change out after Agda shows it fails on the concrete `CP` branch under the current closure-derived law
- update `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`, `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`, and `TODO.md` to record that `heckeSignature` and `eigenSummary` remain observable-side only for the current law, and that adding more canonical transported phase families is now lower-value than a less canonical target family or a stronger dynamics law
- added [`Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`](./Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md)
  to record the now-archived boundary from `Dashi and Physics Insights`:
  Hecke/FRACTRAN belong first on the prime-lattice representation layer rather
  than as the next default conserved charge in the contractive closure lane.
- strengthened `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` with the
  first principled metadata lift from finite-twined report fields into the
  normalized observable, adding `normalizedObservable` report counts, support,
  and eigen-ratio summary data rather than leaving all richer report structure
  stranded under `traceReport`
- updated `Docs/MoonshinePrimeObject.md` and `TODO.md` to record that this
  first principled lift is now landed and that the next moonshine step is a
  richer normalized-observable lift beyond verdict-slot/cardinality metadata

# 2026-04-19

- add `DASHI/Pressure.agda` as the generic finite pressure algebra owner,
  exposing a five-level `Pressure` carrier together with `_⊑p_`, `_⊔p_`,
  upper-bound / least-upper-bound laws, and monotonicity lemmas
- add `Ontology/Hecke/PressureAdapter.agda` as the first thin domain adapter,
  embedding Hecke `PressureClass` into the generic pressure carrier and proving
  the existing `_≤P_` order maps monotonically into `_⊑p_`
- thread the generic pressure carrier into the first Hecke representative
  computation records.
  `Ontology/Hecke/StaysOneMoreStepRepresentativeComputations.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/ExitToAnchoredRepresentativeComputations.agda`, and
  `Ontology/Hecke/ImmediateExitRepresentativeComputations.agda`
  now each expose both the local `PressureClass` tier and the embedded generic
  `Pressure` tier, together with the exact low/medium/high witness for the
  current representative class
- add `Ontology/Hecke/RepresentativePressureOrder.agda` as the first
  theorem-thin generic pressure comparison surface over those Hecke
  representatives.
  It proves the embedded generic ordering
  `stay <= anchored <= immediate-exit`
  without introducing any new pressure source or widening the current owner
  boundary beyond Hecke
- extend that same Hecke comparison surface with the first generic-pressure
  join/summary laws over the representative lanes.
  `Ontology/Hecke/RepresentativePressureOrder.agda`
  now also proves
  `stay ⊔ anchored = anchored`
  and
  `(stay ⊔ anchored) ⊔ immediate-exit = immediate-exit`
  on the embedded generic carrier
- add the first bounded promotion from the weighted valuation forward lane
  into the theorem-side delta bridge.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/DeltaToQuadraticBridgeTheorem.agda`
  now exposes
  `weightedValuationForwardCandidateToDeltaBridge`
  plus
  `weightedValuationForwardCandidateNormalizesQuadratic`,
  so a weighted forward candidate can be reused by the theorem-side bridge
  once a signature bridge is supplied, without widening the open
  cancellation-pressure seam
- update `README.md` and `TODO.md` to record the ownership split:
  generic pressure algebra now lives in `DASHI/`,
  while `Ontology/Hecke/*Pressure*` remains the domain-specific consumer lane
## 2026-05-13 W4/W5 LHAPDF environment clarification

- Clarified the W4/W5 PDF-intake docs after system LHAPDF was installed:
  `/usr/bin/lhapdf`, `/usr/bin/lhapdf-config`, and system Python `lhapdf` are
  available at `6.5.5`, while the repo-local `.venv` still lacks the Python
  binding. CT18NLO resolves with
  `LHAPDF_DATA_PATH=/usr/share/lhapdf/LHAPDF:$PWD/scripts/data/pdf`; no W4/W5
  promotion follows until accepted DY/PDF convention authority is supplied.

## 2026-05-13 non-limited paper interface diagnostic lock-in

- Ran the two blocking interface diagnostics directly against the current repo
  instead of spawning another conditional worker round. `DASHIState` is only a
  dependent carrier package (`Carrier : Set`, `carrierValue : Carrier`) with no
  hidden `FactorVec`/`NormalForm`/p2 update surface, so G3/GR now require an
  explicit adapter/specializer or narrowed selected-state consumer.
- Confirmed the SFGC gauge surface is one-dimensional at the exposed API:
  `GaugeField = ShiftPressurePoint -> Phase4`, `SFGCShiftRightEdge =
  ShiftPressurePoint`, and the edge target is `SSL.rightNeighbor`. No
  `shiftPrime`, `ShiftDirection`, or transverse edge exists, so G2 now requires
  a real two-direction/transverse-edge API before a nondegenerate plaquette or
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier SFGC.GaugeField` can be constructed.
- Updated `Docs/WorkerCoordinationBoard.md` and `TODO.md` to lock these routes
  and prevent more Route A/B/C conditional surface churn. No gate promotion is
  claimed.

## 2026-05-13 selected-carrier / prime-lattice concrete tranche

- Added `DASHI/Geometry/PrimeLattice.agda` as the first standalone
  prime-lattice geometry layer over `Ontology.GodelLattice.FactorVec` and
  `Ontology.Hecke.FactorVecInstances.primeBump`. It defines edges, 2-cells,
  square endpoint sharing via `primeBumpCommutes`, and coefficient-parametric
  `δ₀`, `δ₁`, and `δ₁∘δ₀-zero`. This is a G2 prerequisite only; no
  `DiscreteCurvatureCarrier` or Maxwell promotion is claimed.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/G3ConcreteOperators.agda`, a concrete selected
  operator package over the existing `selectedG3FactorVecDASHIState`, with p2
  and spatial prime-bump operators plus `PP`/`HP` commutation and p2 filtration
  witnesses. G3 remains unpromoted because the wave-function scalar
  ring/bracket semantics, associated-graded Galilei identification, and
  `PoincareToGalileiContractionCarrier` are still missing.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/GRConcreteLeviCivita.agda`, connecting the
  selected FactorVec-backed G3 state to the existing flat constant Minkowski
  finite-r Levi-Civita prerequisite. This closes only the flat selected
  prerequisite; non-flat GR remains open.
- Imported the new modules from `DASHI/Everything.agda` and updated the worker
  coordination board / TODO surfaces to record exact non-promotion boundaries.

## 2026-05-16 Paper 1 narrative geometry pass

- Updated `Docs/PaperDraftWorkingFolder/Paper1_Manuscript.md` and the TeX
  source with a dedicated "Why the Carrier Geometry Is Forced" section. The
  new bridge explains ternary unresolvedness, recursive trie refinement,
  ultrametric distance, prime-lane independence, projection-defect residuals,
  and filtration as one carrier geometry before the manuscript enters the
  formal construction inventory.
- Refined the G6 prose so cross-lane commuting reads as tracked independence
  of distinct valuation exponents on the official `GL.FactorVec` route, while
  preserving the full `LaneOperator` non-promotion boundary.

## 2026-05-16 Paper 1 derivation-priority pass

- Replaced the early closure/frontier-style summary with a derivation map that
  keeps target equations and carrier-to-physics adapters visually central.
- Added derivation lemmas for the abelian/nonabelian gauge split, the
  quotient-grade commutator obstruction, and the Einstein tensor as the
  divergence-free source-facing curvature target.
- Moved the origins/trits/Base369/video lineage out of the main derivation
  path into appendix-style context after the claim-boundary sections.
