# VERID laboratory/world-model max-cut (2026-10-22)

## Ownership and scope

Google VERID is an empirical laboratory instance, **not** a new semantics or world-model compiler. Canonical owners:

- `DASHI.WorldModel.ActionConditionedWorldModelCore`: action-sequence-conditioned rollout, task/guard energies, selected-action authority and dependency witnesses.
- `DASHI.WorldModel.PredicateNormalWorldModelCore`: observation -> carrier -> PNF -> Phi/Psi -> candidate action -> rollout. Proposals are not truth.
- `DASHI.WorldModel.ActionRolloutPullbackCore`: invalid dependency pulls back a rollout.
- `DASHI.Core.ConsumerFibreRepairExact`: non-descent witness forces separation by any globally sufficient refinement; separating one collision is not global sufficiency.
- `DASHI.Interop.SLRBoundedResearchIterationControlExact`: research iteration transport never creates semantic authority or evidence payment.
- Generic SensibLaw/ITIR world-model compiler: domain-specific evidence as candidate source adapters, not parallel compiler.

## This cut

`VERIDLabWorldModelInstanceExact.agda` makes the missing safety/conformity/evidence obligations explicit *on top of* the existing `SelectedActionSequence`, proves contact inherits live-dependency/closed-authority, reuses canonical proposal and pullback proofs, and demonstrates that the fail-closed fixture cannot promote or dispatch an action.

This is a **formal contract and negative fixture**, not a robot-driver implementation or a claim that physical-lab operations are certified.

## Open empirical contacts

1. Concrete laboratory `State`, `Action`, `Trajectory` values and capacity/material/geometry guards.
2. Simulation refinement or bounded error measured against instrument behaviour.
3. Versioned state snapshot bound to dispatch, with calibration and authorization receipts.
4. Native observation and execution traces through typed SLRW/SLRO/SLRX contracts, respecting the source-vs-observation distinction.
5. End-to-end experiment: safe simulated transfer, unsafe overflow rejection, stale-state rejection and observed post-state reconciliation.
6. Source attribution and result ceilings: VERID demonstration evidence is not general autonomous biological discovery.

## Reproduction

From repository root with the pinned Agda/stdlib environment:

```sh
agda -i . -i /path/to/agda-stdlib/src DASHI/WorldModel/VERIDLabWorldModelInstanceExact.agda
```

Use the repository's Agda 2.9 parallel-check wrapper if available. No kernel receipt is attached to this GitHub-side change; source-writing is not kernel certification.

## Acceptance

- Existing semantic owners unchanged.
- New negative fixture is kernel-checked.
- Positive laboratory fixture only after its concrete safety/refinement/observation receipts exist.
- No generated candidate source, selected route, closed contact gate or simulator output is promoted as physical truth.
